## Overview

King's Quest VII features a unique chapter-based structure where you can choose which chapter to start with, though playing in order (Chapters 1-6) is highly recommended for story coherence. The game uses a simple point-and-click interface - if your cursor blinks or sparkles over something, you can interact with it.

### Game Features

- **Bookmarking System**: Instead of traditional save games (Version 1.0 has 1 bookmark, Version 2.0 has multiple)
- **Dual Protagonists**: Play as both Queen Valanice and Princess Rosella
- **Chapter Selection**: Non-linear chapter progression available
- **No Death Gameplay**: Unlike earlier King's Quest games, death is extremely rare
- **Interface**: Single cursor that sparkles when interactive elements are available

### Inventory Tips

💡 **Always examine items closely**: Click items on the Egyptian eye in your toolbar for close-up views. You can rotate items by dragging left/right - many have hidden surprises!
