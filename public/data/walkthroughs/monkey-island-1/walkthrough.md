When you begin the game, you'll find Guybrush Threepwood standing on a cliff overlooking Mêlée Island. Your goal is clear: become a pirate by completing three trials.

#### First Steps

1. **Walk down** to the village
2. **Enter the SCUMM Bar** (the building with the large sign)
3. **Talk to the three important-looking pirates** sitting at the table

The pirates will tell you about the three trials:

- **Sword Fighting** - Master the art of insult sword fighting
- **Thievery** - Steal the Idol of Many Hands
- **Treasure Hunting** - Find the legendary treasure of Mêlée Island

### Trial #1: Master the Sword

#### Learning to Fight

Head to the SCUMM Bar and find the **Sword Master** (she's usually upstairs or in the kitchen area).

**Important Insults and Comebacks:**

- _"You fight like a dairy farmer!"_ → _"How appropriate, you fight like a cow!"_
- _"This is the END for you, you gutter-crawling cur!"_ → _"And I've got a little TIP for you, get the POINT?"_
- _"I've spoken with apes more polite than you!"_ → _"I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion!"_

> **💡 Strategy Tip**: You need to fight several pirates around the island to learn all insult/comeback combinations. Each pirate teaches you new lines!

#### Practice Locations

Visit these areas to find pirates to duel:

- **The Bridge** (north of the village)
- **The Forest** (various clearings)
- **The House** (near the circus tent)

### Trial #2: The Treasure Hunt

#### Getting Started

1. Go to the **Governor's Mansion** (the large building on the hill)
2. **Talk to Elaine** (she's usually on the balcony or in the main hall)
3. She'll give you the **treasure map pieces** after some conversation

#### Decoding the Map

The treasure map consists of **four pieces** that you need to collect:

1. **Piece 1**: From Governor Elaine
2. **Piece 2**: Win it from the **Swordmaster** after mastering insults
3. **Piece 3**: Buy it from the **Citizen of Mêlée Island** (costs 100 pieces of eight)
4. **Piece 4**: Find it in the **kitchen of the SCUMM Bar**

#### Following the Clues

Once you have all pieces:

1. **Examine the completed map** in your inventory
2. The landmarks point to a location **behind the archery range**
3. Use your **shovel** (buy from the store) at the **X marks the spot**

### Trial #3: The Idol Theft

This is often considered the trickiest trial, requiring careful timing and observation.

#### Preparation Phase

1. **Buy a sword** from the store (you'll need it later)

3. **Observe the shopkeeper's routine** during the day

#### The Heist

**Wait until nighttime**, then:

1. **Use the rope** with the **pulley system** above the store
2. **Climb up** to the second floor
3. **Navigate carefully** through the dark store
4. **Take the Idol of Many Hands** from the display case

> **⚠️ Warning**: Don't try to break in during the day - the shopkeeper will catch you and you'll have to start over!

## Part II: The Journey

### Hiring a Crew

Now that you're officially a pirate, you need to assemble a crew for your voyage to Monkey Island.

#### Required Crew Members

- **A Navigator**: Find him at the **jail** (you'll need to bail him out)
- **A Muscle**: The **Sword Master** can be recruited after you prove your worth
- **A Sailor**: Look for someone with sailing experience at the **docks**

![Scumm Bar Crew](/assets/walkthroughs/monkey-island-1/crew-meeting.jpg "Assembling your motley crew")

#### Getting a Ship

1. **Talk to Stan** at **Stan's Previously Owned Vessels**
2. **Negotiate the price** (try to get him down as low as possible)
3. **Choose the Sea Monkey** - it's the best ship for your budget

### The Voyage Preparations

#### Essential Supplies

Before leaving Mêlée Island, make sure you have:

- **Breath mints** (crucial for later encounters!)

## Part III: Under Monkey Island

### The Cannibals

Your ship crashes on Monkey Island, and you're separated from your crew. Time to explore!

![Monkey Island Beach](/assets/walkthroughs/monkey-island-1/monkey-island-beach.jpg "Washed up on the mysterious Monkey Island")

#### Meeting the Locals

1. **Explore the jungle paths** (they're like a maze, but there's a pattern)
2. **Find the cannibal village**
3. **Talk to the Cannibals** - they're surprisingly friendly!

#### The Jungle Maze

The jungle can be confusing, but here's the secret:

- **Always head toward the sound** you want to investigate
- **Use landmarks** like the clearing with the catapult
- **If you get lost**, you'll eventually circle back to a familiar area

### The Ghost Ship

#### Finding LeChuck's Ship

The cannibals will tell you about **LeChuck's ghost ship** and how to find it:

1. **Get the banana picker** from the village
2. **Find the giant monkey head** entrance
3. **Navigate the underground caverns**

![Ghost Ship](/assets/walkthroughs/monkey-island-1/ghost-ship.jpg "The terrifying ghost ship of LeChuck")

#### Underground Navigation

The caverns under Monkey Island are complex:

- **Use your torch** to light the way
- **Follow the sound of dripping water** to find pools
- **Look for carved passages** that lead deeper

## Part IV: Guybrush Kicks Butt

### The Final Confrontation

This is it - the ultimate showdown with the ghost pirate LeChuck!

#### Preparing for Battle

Make sure you have:

- **Root beer** (found in the vending machine on Monkey Island)
- **Your wits about you**
- **A sense of humor** (you'll need it!)

#### The Ghost Ship Battle

![Final Battle](/assets/walkthroughs/monkey-island-1/final-battle.jpg "The climactic battle aboard LeChuck's ship")

**The Solution:**

1. **Use the root beer** on LeChuck when he approaches
2. **Watch the hilarious defeat sequence**
3. **Enjoy one of gaming's most memorable endings**

> **🎮 Fun Fact**: The root beer solution is a clever play on "root beer" vs "root BEER" - and ghost pirates apparently can't handle carbonated beverages!
