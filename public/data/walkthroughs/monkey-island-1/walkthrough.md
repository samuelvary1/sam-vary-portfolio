## Introduction

The Secret of Monkey Island is a comedic point-and-click adventure game filled with humor, memorable characters, and clever puzzles. This game pioneered many adventure gaming conventions and is notable for being virtually impossible to die in (unlike its Sierra counterparts).

### Important Notes

**No Dead Ends**: Unlike many adventure games of its era, you cannot get permanently stuck or die in The Secret of Monkey Island. Feel free to experiment!

**For Your Amusement**: This game is packed with humor and easter eggs. While this walkthrough focuses on completing the game, don't hesitate to explore dialogue options, examine everything, and try unusual combinations for entertainment value.

**Insult Sword Fighting**: One of the game's most memorable features involves learning and countering insults during sword duels. The responses are logical but require wit to figure out.

## The Trials

You can complete these in any order, though doing thievery last means missing a scene with Elaine.

### Treasure-Huntery

- You should reach a screen with red flowers across the bottom
- Go east, look at the plaque and marker
- Use **shovel** on the X

- "People fall at my feet..." → "Even BEFORE they smell your breath?"
- "Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish kebab..." → "First you'd better stop waving it like a feather-duster"
- "There are no words..." → "Yes there are. You just never learned them"
- "This is the END for you..." → "And I've got a little TIP for you, get the POINT?"
- "You fight like a dairy farmer..." → "How appropriate, you fight like a cow"
- "You have the manners of a beggar..." → "I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with us"
