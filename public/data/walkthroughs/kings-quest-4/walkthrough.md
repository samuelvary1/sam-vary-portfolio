## Essential Tips and Strategy

### Character Encounters and Timing

• **Random Characters**: Many characters (minstrel, Pan, cupid, unicorn) appear randomly. Exit and re-enter screens until they show up
• **Save Frequently**: Especially before dangerous encounters (troll, ogre, witches)
• **Screen Navigation**: Stay near screen edges when swimming to avoid sharks

### Dangerous Areas and Precautions

• **Troll in Cave**: Immediately retreat to waterfall if encountered
• **Ogre's House**: Move quickly after getting the hen - the ogre may follow you outside
• **Swamp Navigation**: Save before every jump - falling means death
• **Witch Cave**: Keep moving around the cauldron to avoid the chasing witch

### Item Management Strategy

• **Keep Essential Items**: Don't lose the crown, lantern, board, or flute
• **Shovel Usage**: Save before each digging attempt - the shovel breaks after several uses
• **Inventory Tracking**: Remember where you hide items when captured

### Graveyard Puzzle Solutions

• **Hiram Bennet** (baby) → Baby Rattle
• **Newberry Will** (chains) → Gold Coins  
• **Betty Cowden** (weeping woman) → Locket
• **Lord Coningsby** (lord) → Medal of Honor
• **Willy** (boy) → Toy Horse

### Easter Eggs (AGI Version Only)

• **Whale Interior**: Get bottle and note for Sierra game reference
• **Jail Cell**: Type "RAP KQ" for special message
• **Castle Corridor**: Type "BEAM ME" for another Easter egg

This adventure showcases Rosella's courage and resourcefulness as she faces supernatural challenges to save both her father and the fairy realm. The complex ghost-helping sequence in the haunted house is one of the most memorable puzzle chains in the King's Quest series!
