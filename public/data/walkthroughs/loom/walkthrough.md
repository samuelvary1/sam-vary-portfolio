## 1. Introduction

Loom is a wonderfully imaginative game from Lucasarts that features Bobbin Threadbare as an apprentice in a village of magic practitioners known as Weavers. Only one item is found throughout the entire game: A distaff that makes a series of musical notes appear at the bottom of the screen. As the player progresses through the game, magical drafts are learned which can be used on the numerous objects and characters throughout the world.

One of the first puzzles requires an egg to Open. By looking at the egg, Bobbin receives the Open draft, which can then be used to open any object in the game. Other drafts range from Disappearing drafts so Bobbin can sneak undetected through certain parts of the game, Light drafts, Heal drafts, and drafts that can be cast in reverse to have the opposite effect on an object. Overall, Loom is a short game that can be completed easily, but the atmospheric locations and original interface make this an incredible game.

## 2. Walkthrough

### Village

At the start of the game, Bobbin will be standing on top of the mountain. Walk left along the path to the village, and enter the tent at the left side of the area. Walk through the arch at the right side of the tent, and continue right along the hall with the tapestries to find the elders of the village. After the long cutscene, the elders will leave the tent to chase after the swan. Get the distaff, and musical notes will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Look at the egg to get the **Open** draft. Cast the Open draft by clicking the egg, then entering the notes for the draft by either selecting them with the mouse or typing them with the keyboard. After the egg opens, walk left along the hall and exit the tent. Walk up the path to exit the village, then walk left along the top-left path to find the graveyard in the woods. Walk to the right side of the woods and look at the four holes in the tree to find the **Light** draft.

Exit the forest. Return to the village and enter the middle tent. Look at the darkness and cast the Light draft. Look at the wheel to find the **Straw to Gold** draft. Use this draft on the straw to change it to gold, then exit the middle tent. Enter the right tent. Look at the dye-pot to find the **Dye** draft, and look at the flask on the table to find the **Empty** draft. Use the Dye draft on the wool to dye it green. Exit the tent and walk up the path to exit the village.

Walk right along the path to return to the top of the mountain. Cast Open on the sky, which causes a boat to sail to the dock. Walk left along the path and select the dock at the left side of the village. Walk off the end of the dock to land in the water, then select the boat to sail away from the island. We next find Bobbin near a big waterspout in the ocean. Look at the waterspout to learn the **Twist** draft. Use the reverse Twist draft to make the waterspout vanish, and continue across the water to the beach.

### Beach

Walk to the forest at the top-left corner of the area and walk left down the path to meet the shepherds, who cast the **Appear** draft to become visible. The shepherds ask Bobbin to prove that he is a wizard, but ignore them for now and walk north down the path toward the city.

### City

Walk to the right side of the city to see two workers up in the tall tower. Cast the Appear draft on them, and they are now unable to see Bobbin. Enter the tower and listen to the conversation.

### Tower

Mandible explains that he would like to use the sphere to see eight hours into the future. Walk up to the top of the steps after the conversation, and use the crystal to transport up to the top level of the tower. Look at the scythe to get the **Sharpen** draft, then use the bell at the left side of the room to transport back down to the first floor. Look at the sphere to get the **Vision** draft, which shows Bobbin scaring the shepherds by transforming into a dragon. Use the bell to return to the room with the scythe, use the bell at the right side of the room, and walk through the door to exit the tower.

### Forest

Walk up the path at the left side of the city to return to the forest. Walk left along the path to meet the shepherds again. Look at the shepherds and cast the Vision spell on them. After they run away, walk left along the path to the field. Look at the sheep to get the **Wake** draft. Walk to the left side of the field and enter the barn with the smoking chimney.

Look at the lamb and the Shepherd will appear. Look at the lamb again to get the **Heal** draft. Exit the barn. Look at the sheep and cast the Dye draft to dye them green, which will hide them from the dragon. When the dragon swoops down, she will pick Bobbin up instead to take him back to the cave.

### Dragons Cave

Cast the reverse Straw to Gold draft on the gold, then cast the reverse Wake spell to make the dragon fall asleep. The dragon starts to breathe fire on the straw as she sleeps, which reveals a hidden tunnel at the back of the cave. Walk through the tunnel and cast the Light spell on the darkness. Go through the first tunnel on the left, then follow the path to the tunnel at the right side of the area to enter a room with steps leading down. Go down these steps to return to the maze, and continue up the small path to the fork.

Enter the left tunnel and continue to walk left along the path to drop down to a room with the pool. Look at the pool to get the **Reflect** draft. Cast the Empty draft on the pool, then look at the sphere two times to get the **Human to Swan** spell. Walk around the right side of the pillar to exit the area. Walk through the first tunnel on the right to arrive on the top path. Go right along the path to exit the cave. Cast the reverse Twist draft on the steps, and walk down the long set of steps to the thorny area at the bottom. Cast the Wake draft on the boy to wake him up and use the Reflect draft on him when he falls asleep.

### Blacksmiths Castle

Walk right toward the castle and go through the front door. Walk around to the left side of the wall to arrive on the path in the background, then continue right to find Mr. Stroke, who locks Bobbin in a room. Use the straw, and after the cutscene Bobbin will find that his distaff has been returned to him by Mother Hetchel. Get the distaff and cast the Open draft on the door, then walk through to the room on the other side. Go down the steps and look at Mandible. When he asks how the sword is doing, Edgewise will raise it. Quickly look at the sword and cast the reverse Sharpen to dull the blade. After the cutscene, we next find Bobbin in a cage in Mandible's castle.

### Mandibles Castle

Cast the Open draft on the door of the cage and Bobbin will jump out, only to have his distaff stolen by Mandible. Look at the sphere to defeat Cob. Exit the room and talk to Mandible, then get the distaff from the floor. Return to the castle to find that the green monster from the bottom-left cage has escaped. Walk back out the door, and the monster will push Bobbin out through the hole created by Mandible. Look at the hole and cast the Heal draft on it.

Enter the hole on the left to talk to Rusty, then cast the Heal draft on him. Go back through the hole and cast the Heal draft on it. Go through the next hole on the left to arrive in the shepherd's field. Cast Heal on the shepherds, then return to the hole and cast the Heal draft on it. Float into the green hole on the left and talk to Goodmold.

Float out of the hole and cast the Heal draft on it, then continue left to the pond to talk to the swans. Go left past the pond and enter the final rift to return to the graveyard on Loom island. Walk right to enter the elder's tent in the village. Go through the arch at the right side of the tent and look at Loom. Mother Hetchel will appear, chased by Chaos. After Hetchel has been silenced, look at Loom to get the **Silence** draft.

Cast the reverse Silence draft on Hetchel. After she starts to talk again, Chaos will cast the **Roast** draft on her. Look at Loom to get the Roast draft, and cast the reverse Roast draft to bring her back to normal. After Chaos turns Hetchel into a feather, look at Loom to get the **Rift** draft. Cast the Rift draft to open the rift, leaving Chaos on the other side. Walk into the rift and then cast the Human to Swan draft on Bobbin to complete the game.
