## Essential Strategy Guide

### Critical Item Dependencies

• **Fish is essential** - Without it, the bear won't distract the bees, making the honeycomb impossible to get
• **Amulet protection** - Always wear it in the Dark Forest to avoid the witch's transformation spell
• **Save before timed sequences** - Cat chase, beast encounters, and spell battles require precise timing

### Trading Chain Summary

1. **Silver Coin** → **Pie** (Bakery)
2. **Fish** → Bear distraction → **Honeycomb**
3. **Brass Bottle** → Witch cooperation
4. **Spinning Wheel** → **Marionette** (Gnome)
5. **Golden Needle** → **Cloak** (Tailor)
6. **Marionette** → **Sled** (Toy Shop)
7. **Shoes** → **Hammer** (Shoe Shop)

### Navigation Tips

• **Desert survival**: Always drink at oases - dehydration is deadly
• **Mountain climbing**: The cloak is essential for surviving the cold
• **Labyrinth navigation**: Turn the map as Graham changes direction
• **Ocean travel**: Use the beeswax to seal the boat or it will sink

### Combat and Danger Management

• **Animal encounters**: Most animals can be pacified with music or food
• **Witch encounters**: The amulet provides complete protection
• **Beast in castle**: Timing is crucial - avoid when the cat is present
• **Final battle**: Spell selection order is critical for victory

### Spell Battle Guide

1. **Mordack as Flying Lizard** → Use **Tiger Spell** (#4)
2. **Mordack as Dragon** → Use **Bunny Spell** (#2)
3. **Mordack as Cobra** → Use **Mongoose Spell** (#1)
4. **Mordack as Fire** → Use **Rain Spell** (#3)
