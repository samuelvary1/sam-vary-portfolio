## Introduction

King's Quest (2015) is an episodic adventure game that serves as both a prequel and a reboot to the classic King's Quest series. The game follows the adventures of young Graham as he works to become a knight and eventually King of Daventry.

### The Three Paths

Throughout the game, you can choose different approaches that reflect three core values:

- **🧠 Wisdom**: Focus on intelligence, problem-solving, and magical solutions
- **❤️ Compassion**: Emphasize kindness, helping others, and peaceful resolutions
- **⚔️ Bravery**: Choose direct action, courage, and bold solutions

These choices affect dialogue, cutscenes, and how NPCs react to Graham, but none are "wrong" choices. The townspeople have preferences:

- **Amaya** the blacksmith prefers bravery
- **Wente** the baker prefers compassion
- **Chester and Muriel** the alchemists prefer wisdom

### General Tips

- **Look everywhere**: Adventure games reward thorough exploration
- **Talk to everyone**: Show items to NPCs and ask all available questions
- **Try everything**: Use items on all interactive objects and people
- **No dead ends**: You cannot get permanently stuck in this game

### Controls

- **Action button**: Context-sensitive for talking, picking up items, shooting bow
- **Movement**: Left stick/arrow keys to move and aim
- **Inventory**: Open to view items and use them on objects/people
- **Note**: You cannot combine items in your inventory

---

## The Dragon's Well

🏆 **Trophy Location - "Opening Knight"**: After the scene, open and close the small door three times.

### Shield and Arrow Puzzle

1. **Tell Achaka "Affa Nata!"** when he aims at the sleeping dragon
   - You'll get the dragon's eye for the competition
2. **Tell Achaka "Stalama!"** and he'll aim at the window instead
   - You won't get the eye (Manny will provide one if needed)

## Goblin Fight

This section is only available after completing Achaka's section in the dragon's well.

### Getting There

- Check the competition board near King's statue to get **WHISPER'S PHOTO** if you haven't
- Go to the wolf cave area (north from King's statue, east through trap, north)
- Head east to the area with rope and tree
- Now that you can shoot properly, use the action button on the rope and aim for the tree across the gap
- Cross the rope and head east along the trail
- Graham will sense being watched - just keep backing out of first-person views
- Continue to the wagon at the end, even when goblins start following

### The Fight

Choose your approach:

**Swift Approach**:

- Show no mercy

**Patient Approach** (Easier):

---

## Speed Competition

You need to rescue your steed Triumph before competing. If you already have the **WORK ORDER**, you can skip the retrieval section.

### Getting the Work Order (If Needed)

- Check the competition board at King's statue for **WHISPER'S PHOTO** if you haven't
- You should have the **BLUE FLAME LANTERN** and be friends with Olfie
- Cross Olfie's bridge and go north
- Use the **BLUE FLAME LANTERN** in the dark forest
- Continue to find a big rock with a light beam and **WORK ORDER**
- Take the **WORK ORDER** and head back west

### If You Already Used the Work Order:

If you used it on the boulder for **BITTERROOT**:

- Complete the strength competition first
- Find Acorn stomping near your trapped steed
- Give him his **SOCK** to make friends
- Ask him to help get Triumph down

### Rescuing Triumph:

- Head to the wolf cave and go through to the other side
- Continue to the very end where Triumph is trapped
- Walk up to the tree near Triumph and use **WORK ORDER** on it
- Walk back along the path until Amara arrives with the Crumbler
- Return to Triumph for a scene

### The Race

The speed competition starts automatically. You can't actually lose - if Whisper beats you, Manny will add "one more lap" until you win.

**Lap 1**:

- Move left and right to dodge barriers
- After Whisper takes a nap, jump hay bales and duck under logs using triangle
- Note: Button prompts may disappear quickly, but you still have time to press them

**Lap 2**:

- You'll be in a water wheel - jump hay bales with triangle (different angle)
- You'll lose Triumph and end up on Whisper's back
- Use square and circle to tell Whisper to dodge left or right

**Lap 3**:

- You're on your two new friends, moving slowly
- Use same commands to avoid obstacles and jump hay bales
- Tell Whisper to talk to guards before the hay bale to trip him up
- Tell Whisper to talk to guards again at the bandstand
- Even if you trip him up, he'll still take the lead (fourth lap incoming)

**Lap 4**:

- Jump over obstacles normally
- Tell Whisper to do a handstand under the arch to knock him off
- At the hay bale, tell Whisper to run backwards to trip him
- At the bandstand, tell him to talk to guards and go for the win

### After the Race

- Talk to the crying Whisper and give him his **PICTURE** to make friends
- Ask him to catch a frog for you
- Return to town and give the **FROG** to Chester and Muriel
- Receive the **COLOR-CHANGING POTION** (if you gave them the **FEATHER**, the potion is now complete)

🏆 **Trophy Location - "Fast Feather"**: You automatically get this trophy for beating Whisper.

---

## Strength Competition

You can't win with pure strength, so you need to gather some special items first.

### Preparation

- Check the competition board at King's statue for **WHISPER'S PHOTO** if you haven't
- You should have the **BLUE FLAME LANTERN** and be friends with Olfie
- Cross Olfie's bridge east of King's statue
- Go north and use **LANTERN** in the dark woods
- Take the **WORK ORDER** from the big rock with the light beam (if you haven't done speed competition)
- At the end of the dark path, take the **south** path
- Walk east along the ledge during the meeting
- Climb down the rocks on the right side

### Finding the Secret Meeting

- Walk back past the giant door and continue left
- Climb on the ledge and examine the ladder in the hole
- Use the ladder to climb back up and go west
- Pick up the **GOLD COIN** near the cart on the way
- Use Olfie's mouthpiece to call him, but immediately go east instead of crossing
- Use the ladder to go back down and head east for a cutscene

### The Secret Knock Sequence

After hearing Olfie's secret knock:

- Knock on the door
- Knock again
- Shake the bell tree
- Shake the bell tree again
- Knock again
- Say "Truss me"
- Continue conversations as desired
- **Throw the bell down** when prompted (NOT Olfie's mouthpiece)
- Say you're taking your horn and leaving
- **Select Waddles's mouthpiece** (the one on the right)

Important: Leave with both Olfie's and Waddles's mouthpieces. If you mess up, you'll have to repeat this section.

### Dealing with Pillare

- Head left and back up the ladder
- Go west and use Olfie's horn to cross the bridge
- Use Waddles's mouthpiece on his horn (south of town and pumpkin patch)
- Cross over and go west

Choose one option to make Pillare fall asleep:

**Option 1** (For "Helping Hat" trophy):

- Use **HYPNOTIC POTION** on the croissants to the left of Pillare
- Tell her to take a nap after she eats them

**Option 2**:

- Use **FEATHER** on the pile of croissants
- She'll eat it, get drowsy, and fall asleep
- Note: This prevents completing the potion in the magic shop

- Once she's asleep, grab her **MOUTHPIECE**

### Using Pillare's Horn

- Head to the floating island (north from King's statue, east past trap, follow signs)
- Use Olfie's mouthpiece to cross to the center island
- Walk around left and use Pillare's mouthpiece on her horn instead of climbing the ladder

**Optional Castle Visit**: You can now visit the castle up close. Go through the forest north of where you met Olfie, head east, and use Pillare's mouthpiece on her horn there. Follow the path to see the castle exterior (nothing to do there yet).

### The Actual Competition

- Talk to the guard to start
- He'll push you off the left side (tap button anyway) - Pillare will catch you if you used her horn
- Sneak behind Acorn and grab the ball of yarn
- Press X repeatedly until Acorn starts winding up yarn

**Strategy**: Make yarn lines that cross Acorn's path to trip him:

- Create a plus sign or "X" pattern across the center
- Wait for Acorn to approach a yarn line
- Press X to trip him when he reaches the line (timing is key)
- If mistimed, he'll just stumble; keep trying
- When he falls, hit X multiple times to pull more string

**Round 2**: He'll throw you over the edge

- Use Waddles's mouthpiece on his horn while dangling
- Repeat the yarn-crossing strategy with the new post layout

**Round 3**: Thrown over again

- Use Olfie's mouthpiece while dangling
- Make another yarn cross pattern to trip Acorn
- Pull the yarn again for a cutscene

**Final Phase**: Acorn is angry now

- Run to a post and hit X to wave the sock and get his attention
- Move out of the way so he hits the post instead of you
- Repeat for all the posts

### After the Competition

**If you already did speed competition**:

- Head back toward town until you find Acorn
- Give him his **SOCK** to make friends - he gives you a **PAIR OF SOCKS**
- Talk to him again and he'll push the rock so you can get **BITTERROOT**
- Return to town and give the **BITTERROOT** to Wente for **STRUDEL**

**If you used the WORK ORDER on the boulder**:

- Head to where your steed is trapped (through wolf cave)
- Find Acorn stomping around and give him his **SOCK**
- He gives you a **PAIR OF SOCKS**
- Ask him to help get your steed down

🏆 **Trophy Location - "Strong Minded"**: You automatically get this trophy for beating Acorn.

---

## Test of Wits

The final competition against Manny requires careful preparation and strategy.

### Getting Inside

- Head to the competition hall - your path is blocked by angry squirrels
- Give them the **STRUDEL** and they'll move aside happily
- Give the guard the **PAIR OF SOCKS** to enter
- Cross the bridge and enter the hall

### The Poisoned Cup Game

- Sit down to start the duel of wits
- No matter which cup you choose first, you'll be hypnotized
- Manny will be fine and you must do what he tells you
- The hypnosis will wear off and you can make moves, but you can't win yet
- The guards will rig it for a rematch (and continue until you win)

**Setting Up Your Advantage**:

- Go up to the cups and use the **COLOR-CHANGING POTION**
- Sit down to play again - now you can tell which drink is which
- You can play without being influenced by the hypnosis powder

### The Strategy Board Game

The goal is to shoot Manny's mechanical man with arrows bounced off shields.

**Game Rules**:

- Each turn you can either rotate a shield/your mechanical Graham OR move them one square
- You cannot move a shield man that Manny moved on his last turn
- After your move, you automatically shoot an arrow

**Easier Victory Method**:
If you lose 3 times total (including the forced first loss), you can say "Let's make things more interesting" when sitting down again. Graham will request two cups instead of three. Since you dyed one cup, you can easily avoid the poison and let Manny get the hypnotic powder. He'll be under your control for the first few moves, letting you set up an easy win.

### The Final Duel

After winning the board game, you have 3 options for the duel:

- Use crosshairs to flick your last **GOLD COIN** to one of the shopkeepers
- Each option represents bravery, wisdom, or compassion
- Complete a few quick-time button events
- You're done!

🏆 **Trophy Location - "The End?"**: You automatically get this trophy for completing the chapter.
