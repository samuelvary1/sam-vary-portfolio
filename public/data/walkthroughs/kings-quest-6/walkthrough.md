The guard dogs call Saladin, the captain of the guards, who lets Alexander in for an audience with the vizier Abdul Alhazred.

Alhazred is accompanied by a genie who has a twinkle in his eye. Alhazred doesn't allow anybody to see Cassima. When she returned from captivity in Mordack's castle (in King's Quest 5), she learned that her parents, the king and queen of the Land of the Green Isles, had died, and she is mourning their passing. In addition Alhazred says she will soon marry with him as her parents had desired and it would be inappropriate for Alexander to see her.

Alexander is asked to leave the castle and no longer allowed to enter.

**Jester Encounter:**

It's Jollo and he knows who Alexander is because Cassina told him about Alexander when she returned from Mordack's castle. She then learned about her parents death and has been sequestered in mourning since. The vizier said she willingly does so out of respect for old customs. Jollo doesn't trust the vizier though or his plans for Cassima whom he deeply cares about. He regrets not having spoken to Cassima since she secluded herself. Alexander learns she has a pet nightingale, called Sing Sing.

He learns the vizier came to the kingdom 15 years ago and became the king and queen's confidante, later to become vizier. He's had his eye on Cassima since she was a young girl and now she's the only thing between him and the throne. Cassima distrust him, but she's vulnerable and alone and the vizier wants to take her to his advantage.

### Winged Ones

You run into winged Guards. Nobody has been welcome on the Isle of the Sacred Mountain in years, since the Red and White Queen had the Winged Ones' golden fleece stolen. Alexander is taken to lord Azure and Lady Arielle, rulers of the Winged Ones.

Alhazred has just informed the Winged Ones to dispose of any strangers that might land on their island. Luckily, Alexander is the first person in centuries to have climbed the Cliffs of Logic and, as the sacred Oracle's Prophecy has claimed, the one to do so would defeat the Minotaur that has occupied the winged Ones' sacred catacombs and eats the Winged One's children in sacrifice. Their own daughter, lady Celeste, was taken there only this morning as his most recently demanded offering.

Lord Azure decides to lock Alexander up in the catacombs, giving him a chance to defeat the minotaur, but expecting him not to make it out alive - therefore fulfilling both the Vizier's command and honoring the prophecy's demand.

The Oracle explains that there are two paths to save Cassima from evil. One of those paths is to save two restless spirits from the Realm of the Dead so they can aid Alexander in his quest. She recommends counseling the reclusive Druids on their island hidden in the mist. Lastly the Oracle gives Alexander a vial of sacred water.

## Different Endings

### Alexander's Ring

If Alexander sends his signet ring to Cassima, Cassima will have the ring at the wedding ceremony. If he didn't, then he will give it to Cassima at the wedding itself. And if he left the ring at the pawn shop, there will be no wedding ring at the ceremony.

### Queen Allaria and King Caliphim

If Alexander rescued them from the Realm of the Dead, they will appear at the vizier's wedding and unmask the genie's disguise. They will also be present at Alexander's and Cassima's wedding, giving away the bride and offering Alexander the crown.

If they were not rescued then Alexander will unmask the genie's disguise with a mirror. At Alexander's and Cassima's wedding, Jollo gives away the bride and captain Saladin will ask Alexander to become king.

### Jollo

If Alexander never makes friends with Jollo, then he will call the guards when Alexander enters his room in the castle basement. He will also be at the vizier's wedding. He's also at Cassima's and Alexander's wedding, but isn't too happy.

If Alexander befriends Jollo then he's not at the vizier's wedding. If Alexander gives Jollo the replica of the genie's lamp, then Jollo will swap them and bring the real lamp in the final fight scene. Jollo will be at Alexander and Cassima's wedding, performing happily.

### Genie

If Alexander saves the genie, then the genie will be present at the wedding, along with King Graham, Queen Valanice and Princess Rosella, as the genie has recovered access to the lands. If Alexander has discovered the stolen treasures then the rulers of the other Isles are also at the wedding. King Graham gives away the groom.

If Alexander kills the genie, then neither the genie, nor the Daventry family, nor the rulers of the other islands will be present at the wedding. Captain Saladdin approves Alexander's marriage.
