## Essential Combat & Strategy Guide

### Combat Effectiveness by Enemy Type

#### Early Game (Daventry)

- **Goblins**: Easy fist/dagger targets for experience
- **Spriggans**: Use crossbow from distance, dangerous up close
- **Henchmen**: Tough enemies requiring shield potions and strong weapons

#### Mid Game (Death/Swamp/Gnomes)

- **Skeletons**: Crossbow from distance, sword for cleanup
- **Rock Demons**: Hand weapons work well, moderate difficulty
- **Swamp Creatures**: Hammer throw for Bubbles, sword for others

#### Late Game (Barren/Frozen/Sun)

- **Pyro Demons**: Crossbow mandatory, lava makes melee impossible
- **Frost Demons**: Slow but lethal, crossbow while backing up
- **Ice Orcs**: Crossbow effective, dangerous in groups

### Equipment Progression

#### Weapons Path

1. **Fists** → **Dagger** → **Axe** → **Sword of Lake**
2. **Crossbow** → **Heavy Crossbow** → **Ice Crossbow**
3. **War Hammer** → **Super Battle Axe** → **Black Diamond Pike** → **Flame Sword**

#### Armor Path

1. **Leather pieces** → **Chain Mail** → **Bronze Breastplate**
2. **Full Armor** → **Armor of Light** → **Permanent Spell effects**

### Resource Management

#### Critical Save Points

- Before difficult jumps (mausoleum roof, ice blocks, lava stones)
- Before major battles (Henchmen, Dragon Wyrm, Basilisk, Drake)
- Before complex puzzles (floating tiles, stone columns, mask assembly)

#### Healing Priority

1. **Healing Springs/Wells** (free, unlimited)
2. **Mushrooms** (abundant, 5 HP each)
3. **Crystals** (50 HP, save for emergencies)
4. **Sacred Water** (100 HP, very rare)
5. **Elixir of Life** (full heal, extremely rare)

### Puzzle Solutions Quick Reference

#### Symbol Sequences

- **Death Floating Tiles**: Strange pitchfork → Half circle with dot → Circle with dot → Back-to-back half circles
- **Sarcophagus/Safe**: Crescent → Triangle → Circle → Square
- **Gong Tower**: 4, 2, 7, 5, 1, 3, 6 (rainbow color order)

#### Pressure Plate Solutions

- **Stone Blocks**: Prime numbers ascending (1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17)
- **Central Tower**: Use rocks or zombie bodies on 4 corner plates
