  - 2 large eggs
  - 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
  - 1/2 tsp salt

  - 3/4 cup white chocolate chips
  - 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
  - In a large bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy (about 2–3 minutes).
  - Beat in eggs and vanilla extract until smooth.
  - In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
  - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until just combined.
  - Fold in oats, raisins, white chocolate chips, and nuts if using.
  - Scoop about 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie onto prepared sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.
  - Bake for 10–12 minutes, until edges are golden and centers are just set.
  - Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
tips:
  - Chill dough for 30 minutes for thicker, chewier cookies.
  - Reduce white chocolate chips to 1/2 cup if you prefer less sweetness.
  - Add a pinch of clove for extra spice depth.
