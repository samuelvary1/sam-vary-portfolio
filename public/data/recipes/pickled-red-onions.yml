image: /assets/recipes/pickled-red-onions.png

ingredients:
  - 2 medium to large red onions, thinly sliced
  - 1 1/3 cups water
  - 1 1/3 cups white vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon kosher salt
  - 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns

instructions:
  - "Optional: For softer, less sharp onions, blanch the slices in boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain. Skip this step if you prefer them crunchier and tangier."
  - Place sliced onions into a clean 32 oz mason jar.
  - In a small pot, combine water, vinegar, salt, sugar, and peppercorns. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring until salt and sugar dissolve.
  - Pour the hot brine over the onions, ensuring they are fully submerged.
  - Let cool to room temperature, then seal the jar and refrigerate.
  - Allow to pickle for at least 1 hour before serving; best after 24 hours. Keep refrigerated for up to 2â€“3 weeks.
