A young girl of about 9 sat bolt upright in a cell at the end of a dim corridor, her eyes wide and staring. She began to tremble all over. The old man who had taken her prisoner was now finally coming to collect his dues.  She looked around desperately for a place to hide, though she knew there was no shelter to be had. Even if she tried to go under the cot on which she sat, a row of torches glowing in the hall eliminated every shadow. Even if there had been somewhere to run, her legs wouldn't do her any good - they had transformed into twin blocks of wood. Her heart thudded dully in her chest; her veins ran with ice water. She heard a leathery thump as a pair of boots descended the dungeon steps. In another minute, the tall man was standing in front of her cell.  \"Please, sir,\" she stammered. \"I want my parents. I want to go home.\" Without a word he slipped a loop of keys from his pocket and selected one with long, slender fingers. He unlocked the cell and let the barred gate swing open before\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 2 finally raising his eyes to look at the girl. His maroon cloak shimmered in the torchlight, and she shrank back against the brick wall under his gaze.  \"Get up,\" he growled. \"It's time to go.\" He'd been nice before. Almost fatherly. The little girl had even begun to trust him, and believe his promises of a better life. Now the guise had fallen. All she wanted was to be back on the farm with her family. She didn't care if the Harvest yielded nothing. She only wanted to see her parents again.  \"My daddy will find me. He'll come and rescue me and you'll be sorry,\" she said. There was a sliver of defiance in her voice that surprised them both.  \"Oh, I don't think so,\" the king said. \"He's dead now. Killed himself in the barn out behind your house three days ago, as a matter of fact. He already knew you were gone for good. Now come on, there's no point in delaying the inevitable.\" His words took a moment to hit home, but when they did, shock and disbelief washed over her like a black tidal wave. Sobs racked her thin frame. She tried to accuse him of lying, that her daddy would never do a thing like that, but no words would come.  Vladimir Cruor, the Red King of Zimarron, had run out of patience.  He strode into the cell and snatched the girl by her hair. Her sobs morphed into screams of pain and terror as he dragged her out roughly into the corridor, the noise ricocheting off the glistening stone walls of the dungeon, which contained seven other cells besides hers. There had been other children, but Cruor had processed them several weeks earlier, and the rooms now stood empty. On the floor behind the second set of bars was a large pool of dried blood, the only trace that remained of a boy named Jethro. He'd been a bit older than the little girl, a bit stronger, and in the end Vlad had needed\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 3 to summon Henrietta to help subdue the lad. Her razor-sharp teeth had pacified him in a hurry. Cruor could handle one little girl on his own just fine, however. He pulled her along the stone floor without much difficulty, in spite of her prolonged kicking and screaming. He had enough sympathy in his boiled old heart to at least carry her under one arm when they ascended the dungeon steps, but that was the extent of his mercy. Now that her time in his care was drawing to a close, he had mostly lost interest in bedside manner. A wry grin crossed his lips. Her pain and suffering will be over soon enough, he thought. They went through the dungeon entrance and around a corner, down another long hallway hung with ancient tapestries. Cruor came to a stop at the base of a spiral tower, which jutted straight up through the center of his fortress. A black archway gaped at them like a toothless maw. As the pair entered the tower, the shadowy entrance seemed to swallow them whole.  The king ascended the steps with the little girl still under his arm. She had ceased to struggle, apparently having exhausted herself. This came as a welcome development. He was no longer the young ruler he had once been, but he insisted on carrying out this unpleasant business himself as much as possible. They reached the top of the tower and found themselves in front of an oaken door. With his free hand, Cruor took another key and slid it into a large padlock. This lock was attached to a chain which had been wound tightly around a bolt-style handle. As he released the hasp of the padlock, the chain slid to the floor with a ringing clatter. They stepped into the room.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 4 A surreal, tinny tune shuddered out of a music box off to one side, seemingly wound by an unseen hand. The cover snapped open; a blue ballerina dipped and pirouetted within. Cruor lowered the girl, and she barely managed to stay standing under her own power. Her lips moved in a soundless whisper. \"Why,\" might have been the word she was trying to form, but nothing would come. Her entire body was paralyzed with fear. And yet bizarrely, questions rose to mind. Logical questions. For instance, why was there was a crib in one corner? Or why the king would have a bizarre rendition of a child's bedroom at the top of a tower? She suddenly realized that the mobile which spun lazily above the crib was made from bones. She could not tell whether they were chicken wings or kids' fingers. An assortment of button-eyed dolls and wooden toys lay scattered about the floor, as though someone else had suddenly been interrupted while playing. A large chest with an intricate design carved into its lid sat in the opposite corner. She thought she could hear a soft thumping noise from within, but it could have been the maddening pulse of blood in her own ears. Then, a loud bang drew her attention immediately to something else, beside the crib. Something she hadn't had time to consider yet.  The closet door. The king raised one hand and snapped his fingers twice in quick succession - clack clack! The girl flinched, still not daring to move - or hope. She tried to fill her mind with images of relaxing on the farm, watching her father break in wild horses that would later become the proud mounts of the Zimarron calvary. In her young heart, she knew her luck had run out. At Cruor's signal, the closet door slammed outward. It left a dent in the periwinkle blue wallpaper as the handle hit the opposite wall. More accurately, it\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 5 enhanced an existing dent. This door was not opened gently very often. Cruor turned quickly to leave, reattaching the chain and locking the door behind him. Henrietta would take it from here. Eyes glowed in the closet like twin rubies. A forked tongue flicked out, just enough to be visible from the gloom. Long toenails clacked as the thing glided forward with reptilian ease. The girl began to scream.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 6                CHAPTER 2  Roger Detwiler sat on the floor of his father's study, nodding his head in rhythm as the lead singer of Steppenwolf lurched into another gritty chorus. The spinning of the record player was almost as pleasantly hypnotic as the music itself. In that mild Maine summer of 1999, Roger had found himself deeply in love with his father's record collection. He often lost track of time while listening. A gentle knock came at the study door and broke the boy from his trance. It was his little brother George. \"Roger, come down! Dad says you have to help set the table,\" he said. George's voice sounded surprisingly confident for an 8-year-old. Roger reluctantly switched off the record player, and the music whirled to a stop. \"Be right there, buddy,\" he said. # Following their evening repast, the boys spent their pre-bedtime hour reading with their dad Leo, sprawled out his king-sized bed, absorbed in their current books. After a time,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 7 Roger and Leo looked over and realized that George had conked out, and their dad said it was time for bed. Roger got up and trudged down the hall to the bedroom they shared, while Leo carried George over one shoulder behind them. Twin beds stood side by side, with a patchwork quilt covering each one. Leo tucked George under his covers, and Roger climbed into his own bed, still feeling wide awake and not ready to sleep. Across the room, George curled up on his side and began to snore softly.  Leo knelt beside Roger's bed and said in a low, confidential tone, \"There's something I want to give you, but I had to wait for George to fall asleep first.\" \"What is it?\" Roger asked, his curiosity piqued. Leo withdrew a small knife from his pocket, which folded neatly into a wooden handle. Roger could make out the word Barlow engraved on a metal band around the top of the grip. \"I've had this since I was a kid, but I want you to have it. You're almost a teenager now, and I figure you can handle a little more responsibility. So here, it's yours, but be careful - I just got it sharpened.\" He held out the pocketknife and Roger took it, testing its weight. \"Wow, it's great Dad.. thank you,\" Roger said, unsure what else to add. \"You're welcome,\" Leo said, sounding a little self-conscious himself. \"I'm.. I'm going to get George something special too, soon.\" \"Don't worry,\" Roger said, \"he and I can share it. We'll carve our names in the treehouse together.\" This made Leo smile.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 8 Roger put it on the nightstand and gathered the covers up below his chin. It was still early enough in the summer to make sleeping under a blanket comfortable, and he felt nothing but warmth and security. \"Sounds good, buddy. Now get some rest,\" Leo said. He switched off the light and gently closed the door before heading downstairs, where Roger assumed he'd smoke a pipe and read the evening paper. Roger realized that he was sleepier than he'd thought at first, and quickly began to drift. # Vladimir Cruor stood in a dark chamber and stared into a glimmering green reflecting pool. His faithful manservant Mandrake wrung his hands nervously off to one side. \"There's no one left, Mandrake,\" Cruor said with an air of defeat. They'd already been in the room for three hours. \"Sire, perhaps it's time to explore other options.\" \"If we cross the threshold into the Earth-realm, there could be no going back,\" he muttered. \"But there are no viable children left here. Begging your pardon, sire, but we've used them all up. If we don't go over there to look, an uprising here in Zimarron will be inevitable.\" \"Don't you think I know that?\" \"Yes, of course. I didn't mean to offend.\" \"You have someone in mind?\" \"I do indeed. If I may...\" Mandrake stepped forward and swirled his finger in the pool before Vladimir. A watery picture of a white house drew into focus.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 9 \"Two boys, both strong of mind and heart. The older one could keep the machine running for a year or more.\" Cruor raised an eyebrow. \"It'll be the standard dream insertion. I'll get word to the Grimsrud brothers to handle intake. You can go this very evening, if you like.\" \"Well, what are we waiting for?\" \"Very good sire, I'll prepare the elixir immediately.\" # Roger slept deeply for an hour or two. Then, he began to have a lucid dream unlike anything he'd ever experienced before in his life. It started with a deep voice in his head. \"Open your eyes, son.\" Roger blinked and looked around. The room around him was completely dark. Moonlight streamed in the window and cast a scattered interplay of silver light and black shadows across the foot of his bed. A tall, dark figure was standing in the corner of his room. Roger jerked backwards in terror and tried to cry out, but no sound would come. His movements felt sluggish, but he still had no idea he was dreaming. The same voice seemed to swirled through the room again like audible tendrils of mist. \"Calm down, son. I mean you no harm, but it's time to get up. There's something I need you to see.\" Roger was surprised to detect nothing malevolent in the voice, and so arose, albeit sluggishly. He began to walk across the room. But the faster he tried to move, the more he seemed to slow down. It took considerable effort just to reach the doorway. A\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 10 pale glow emanated from the hallway beyond, and in the moonlight Roger could now see that his strange visitor was wearing some kind of red robe. The tall man turned his back and stepped into the hall. He raised one bony finger and beckoned Roger to follow. \"That's right, this way. I won't bite...\" Roger followed, urged on by his own curiosity. He stepped forward, confidently at first, then hesitating on the threshold of the bedroom. Some sixth sense suddenly cried out that something might be wrong with this picture. He glanced back over his shoulder. The bedroom behind him appeared to tilt one way, then gently back in the opposite direction. It created a pleasant, swaying effect in his blurred vision. At last he turned back, raised one foot, and placed it just beyond the door. \"There's a good lad.\" Roger snapped his gaze forward. The figure turned around. Roger found himself staring at an old man who stood directly before him, dressed all in crimson. He leered down at the boy, baring crooked teeth that gave off a distinctly wolfish appearance. Roger gazed upon the leathery face, transfixed. Watery blue eyes stared back at him, glinting in the moonlight. The skin of the man's hands looked as old and hard as driftwood, tanned to a deep bronze hue. In one hand he gripped a sturdy wooden staff that came up to his hunched shoulders. \"Would you like to know my name?\" the man asked. His grin stretched wider, showing a red-tinged gum line and more jagged incisors. Roger swallowed hard. \"Ah... y-yes? What is it?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 11 \"Vladimir Cruor, at your service!\" He said with a flourish of one hand. \"Don't be frightened, son. I said I mean you no harm, and I wouldn't tell a lie to such a nice, supple young man.\" He grinned and licked his lips. \"I'm not afraid,\" Roger said, hoping he sounded more confident than he felt. \"Well! That's very good to hear, because where we're going you'll have to be brave. Would you like to see something amazing?\" Roger nodded, but his sense that something might be wrong grew stronger with each passing moment. He couldn't understand how the man had gotten into his house, and glanced anxiously in the direction of his father's bedroom. He kept his cool, however, and when Cruor again gestured for him to follow, Roger's curiosity got the better of him once more.  The stairs creaked under their weight as Roger trailed the robed figure downstairs to the landing below. Suddenly, the old man turned and placed a large, gnarled hand on the boy's shoulder. A shudder crawled up Roger's spine. \"Come outside. It's only a little farther, I promise.\" Together, they stepped into the cool night air. Cruor strode in the direction of the forest, which stood, gnarled and enchanting, a short distance beyond the house. Roger strode down the hill after his guide. He had the distinct impression that he was floating, or as though someone else were controlling his legs for him.  In another moment they had arrived at the edge of the forest. Roger had followed without hesitation, and now felt prepared to keep moving, go wherever this robed figure asked him to go; and yet a palpable sense of foreboding grew within his chest.  They entered the woods. Up close now, Roger saw that the bark of the trees around him was slimy and black, and the jutting branches seemed to stretch toward him\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 12 like skeletal arms, bobbing slightly in the breeze. A carpet of dead leaves crackled with decay underfoot. Cruor kept glancing back to smile at Roger. He seemed eager for the boy to place his trust in him, but there was a cold light in those icy blue eyes that was both dead and alive at the same time. The old man stopped at the foot of a tree that seemed to tower above the rest, and was quite a bit thicker than just about any of the other trees that Roger could see as well. The boy dutifully came up to stand beside him. In the center of the tree  he saw a large opening, the kind where one might imagine a family of squirrels making its home - that, or a poisonous snake, coiled and fat, waiting to strike if an exploratory hand were to reach inside. He looked around and was vaguely surprised to find that the forest was utterly silent. Not even the hoot of an owl or the chirping of crickets greeted his ears.  \"Here we are, Roger.\" He gestured to the tree. \"I want you to look inside. There's a doorway here, and a land of untold wonders just beyond. A whole world that can be yours if you're as brave as you say you are.\" Cruor motioned towards the opening with his staff. Feeling like a puppet on a string, Roger leaned forward to peer inside the tree. What he saw next left him breathless. A magnificent blue whirlpool of light forced him to shield his eyes for a brief moment. It was more dazzling and wondrous than any natural phenomenon he had ever seen before. The pool seemed to be infinitely deep, yet he could see that it was perfectly enshrined within the dark tree. The edges of the vortex bubbled and foamed like the tide of a hungry ocean, and he found himself completely entranced, staring as deeply as possible into its center. He was hypnotized. He suddenly felt a desperate urge to reach out and touch its surface.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 13 As if privy to his thoughts, Cruor said \"That's all right, go ahead and reach in. There's a world in there, Roger, one of unimaginable wealth and beauty. It can all be yours if you do what I say. Climb into the tree, son. My friends and I are all just dying to see you.\" Roger sensed he had arrived at a crossroads, but perhaps it was more than that. He felt an almost crushing weight to his decision as he gazed into the blue abyss.  Suddenly, behind them, a branch snapped. \"Roger?\" a soft, familiar voice called out. \"What are you doing?\" He spun toward the sound and tried to speak as he blinked again.  He said, \"George, is that you?\"  Suddenly he was awake, and the man in red had disappeared. A wave of confusion swept over him as he realized he was barefoot in the forest in the middle of the night. He saw George coming towards him from the edge of the trees. \"Roger, it's me! What are you doing out here? You got up and I followed you,\" his little brother said. \"It's cold out here. Can we please go back inside?\" \"Sure, sure - wow, did I sleepwalk... out here? I was just having the weirdest dream...\" \"Roger, I was scared. I woke up and you were gone. I came outside and you had already walked down the hill and were almost in the woods.\" \"Wow, I... I don't know what... let's just go inside, okay? I'm sorry I scared you.\"  They headed back towards the house, but George paused, a look of concern writ large on his face.  \"What were you looking at inside that tree?\" he asked.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 14 Roger glanced back, trying to locate the one, but the memory of the dream itself was fading too quickly from his mind. He realized he had already lost track of the tree in the darkness.  He shook his head. \"I'm not really sure, buddy.\" \"I know which one it was,\" George said. \"We've climbed that tree before. Remember I fell down and landed right on my back?\" \"Yeah, you got the wind knocked out of you pretty good, all right,\" Roger said, yawning. \"You were just standing there and looking inside that same tree. You seemed awful interested in whatever it was.\" \"Yeah, I don't know. Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" The brothers trooped back up the hill toward the house, past the stone wall with the alligator-shaped rock, and finally up the wooden steps that led to the porch. When they were back in the bedroom, Roger crawled back under the covers, blissfully unaware of the mud and detritus he had tracked into the room. George got into bed as well without another word. He glanced over to make sure his big brother was all right. Within minutes sleep had swept over Roger once more. But George stayed awake.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 15               CHAPTER 3  George waited until he was absolutely sure that Roger had fallen back asleep. He listened to his breathing, and when it had drifted into a constant rhythm, he put his feet on the floor and silently padded out of the room and downstairs. He was puzzled, but his curiosity was aflame. When had Roger ever sleepwalked before? And what had been so fascinating inside that tree? In the darkened living room, George slipped on a pair of sneakers, tugged the laces tight and walked out the back door, then out across the moonlit field. The chill air gave George goosebumps, but in an almost pleasant, refreshing way. The lawn felt springy underneath his Chucks, and he almost started skipping as he drew near the forest, eager to solve the little mystery at hand. George held a pretty serious grudge against that tree for the way it had betrayed his trust a summer ago, by taking a perfectly sturdy-looking branch and turning it into a rotten, crackling booby trap. It had given way almost as soon as he had placed his full weight upon it. George hesitated for a moment at the edge of the woods, glancing longingly back toward the safety of the big white farmhouse. But no, he'd come too far to chicken out\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 16 now. He looked for the tree, and spotted it almost at once. He touched his pocket and realized he had kept his lucky toy train with him. It had been in the pocket of the red shorts he'd put on before going out to follow Roger, and he ran one finger over its little wooden wheels. They spun in a familiar, reassuring way at his touch.  He made his way to the tree, feeling bolder with each step. The looming oak seemed mostly as he remembered it. He walked around to the side that faced away from the house, and immediately saw what it was that Roger had been staring at so intently. The gaping mouth in the tree trunk was something that had never been there before, at least as far as George could remember. The edge of the hole seemed to crinkle, like the lips of a toothless mouth. He promptly stuck his head inside the knot, and gasped. Flashing blue lights met his gaze, and he had to squint hard against the glare. The forest around him swirled in relief. But rather than faze him, the glowing portal sent a burst of adrenaline through his veins. Roger must have thought this thing was only in his dream, or he forgot about it as soon as he woke up, he reasoned. But here he stood, wide awake himself and staring right at it: a pool of brilliant light inside a tree that looked completely normal on the outside. The light hummed with energy and sloped into what seemed like infinity. He wanted to reach his hand in. Hell, he wanted to climb inside altogether. He didn't want to get electrocuted, but it was so hauntingly beautiful.  That was when a voice floated up from below. \"I can make all your wildest dreams come true...\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 17 George froze. The woods creaked softly around him in the night breeze. It was the only sound. The glowing vortex did not change, both in brilliance and agitation. George stared and held his breath, listening for the voice. Another deep moan rose up to greet his ears. \"Come down, my son, everyone is waiting for you! Don't disappoint them...\" He did not worry about what might await him on the other side. The weight of his own head seemed to be pressing him forward. He was all but powerless to resist. Before George even realized what he was doing, he had scrambled up and over the edge of the knot. His eyes were glowing orbs. He plunged headfirst into the vortex. Then, everything went black. # When Roger opened his eyes to sun streaming into his room the next morning, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Not at first, anyway. George often arose earlier than his older brother did, and when Roger glanced over and noticed that the other bed was empty, he assumed he'd gone downstairs to watch cartoons. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and dug the crust out of his eyes. It was at that moment that he spied another crust that had resulted from the previous night. He was momentarily shocked to find that he had a thick layer of mud caked on his feet. He lifted up the blankets to see he had made quite a mess in there as well. His face turned red as he thought about what his dad might say when he told him he needed a change of sheets. As the fog of sleep lifted, Roger's midnight adventure suddenly returned to him in a rush of clarity. He remembered how George had woken him up, and how they'd gone back in the house together, but at the time he'd been too disoriented to know what had\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 18 brought him out to the woods. Now in the light of day, he thought about how strange that dream had been after all. He decided to get up and join George downstairs for some Looney Tunes in the family room.  Strange. He didn't hear the customary explosions and xylophone music, and when he came around the corner at the bottom of the stairs, there was no one in the room. He glanced around the room in confusion, unable to comprehend George's absence. The kitchen was silent as well.  Roger's eyes drifted down to the carpet, where he noticed some faint shoe prints forming a track out the back door. These led onto the back porch, and traced the same route the two had taken to come back inside the previous night. More of the dream seemed to brighten up in his memory. What was it that voice had said, something about another world? he thought. It still didn't make sense, but the image of the foaming blue portal inside the tree came back with a jolt. His heart sank. \"Oh Jesus, George, you've got to be kidding me,\" he groaned. He burst out the door and broke into a run toward the woods. It wasn't hard to tell the direction in which his little brother must have been headed, assuming that he had left the house. Plus, George had mentioned he knew which tree it was. That's right! It was the one he fell out of when we tried to climb it last year. Roger got to the edge of the forest and saw it at once: a large, slightly rotten oak with bark that seemed to have taken on a much darker hue since the last time he really looked at it. He inched closer despite a strange sense of revulsion.  He suddenly spotted something lying on the ground. It was a toy train, and he recognized it immediately. It was from a Thomas the Tank Engine set that the boys'\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 19 grandparents had given George for Christmas a couple years ago. Roger plucked it off the ground and turned it over in his hand, knowing full well that it was the same one that George kept around for good luck.  He circled the tree and found what he was looking for on the opposite side: a huge hole in the trunk that a kid could easily climb through. He felt a shiver as he looked at its black, staring eye. He must have stood right here, and ... what? Leaned over, dropped the train, and jumped inside? He thought back to the way those lights had seemed to hypnotize him. He was beginning to doubt it had really been a dream at all. \"Oh George, what have you gotten yourself into...\" Roger murmured.  He glanced around to make sure he was alone, then put his hands on the edge of the opening and looked inside. He blinked hard as the same brilliant wave of light met his eyes. Before him churned a whirlpool of twinkling crystals. The vortex crackled with thin beams like static electricity. At that moment a breeze rose up behind him, ruffling his hair and and causing a layer of goosebumps to break out all over his arms. He now knew beyond a doubt that George had gone through. The only thing left to do was go in after him. He had to rescue him, plain and simple. Roger steeled his nerves and prepared to dive in. He placed his hands on the edge and grimaced. An oily sort of perspiration had begun to form on the edge of the opening. The body of the tree almost seemed to be pulsating in a way that made him think of alligator skin - that same slick roughness, but alive somehow. He forced all thoughts of his own safety aside, and concentrated entirely on his resolve to get George back. He could not live without his brother.  Roger crawled into the opening and balanced there with his stomach over the lip. God I hope you're in there George.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 20 He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and plunged head-first into the blue.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 21                 CHAPTER 4  George had a slight headache when he came around, but it began to dissipate almost immediately. He had no idea how much time had passed. He remembered tumbling into the blue whirlpool, but that had been his last conscious thought before he wound up... here. Wherever here was. He sat up and patted himself down to make sure he was still in one piece. The air felt cool on his skin, and he looked up to see a glittering canopy of stars overhead. There must be an infinite number of them up there, he thought. A few went streaking through space, then disappeared in the blink of an eye. The chilly night air seemed to draw in around him like a cloak. There was something in the atmosphere that felt very different from the woods around their house in Maine; it was more still somehow, and he could no longer hear any of the peepers or crickets that he had always associated with home. A thick, dead silence hung in the air. He looked around. The moon was hidden behind a dense cloud on an otherwise clear night, but the stars provided enough light for George to get at least some sense of the terrain. A barbed wire fence stretched along a road that ran to his left and right\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 22 behind him, and to his right was a smaller road - more of a path, really - that led straight to... it. \"It\" was a three-story mansion. Its hulking shape was just visible in the dark, and stood at the end of the path. The huge A-frame of the roof formed an imposing silhouette against the sky, and several windows on the front stared back at George like blank, glassy eyes. He got up and made his way closer.  He decided it would be best to proceed very carefully, but he knew he needed to find help. One foot followed the other, and before long he was right outside the front door. The structure seemed even more disproportionately large now that he had gotten close enough to see the front door. Too big for anyone normal to live here, George thought. He gulped hard against the knot of fear that had suddenly formed in his throat. George looked around to the left. His ears detected nothing. So far, so good. He decided to check out the opposite side of the house. He rounded the far corner and immediately saw a warm glow emanating from a window on the first floor. In the pale light he thought he could make out a field beyond the backyard of the house, but it was difficult to tell what was out there. He focused his attention on the window, and moved to position himself just below it. Suddenly the sounds of voices inside greeted his ears. The rest of the house was dark and silent. The window was too high off the ground for him to see through. Looking down, however, he found a pile of discarded crates, and he could read the words ZIMARRON BARLEY CO. stamped on the side of each one in ornate lettering. Thinking quickly, George managed to fashion a crude stepladder by turning them upside down and stacking them up, two crates ascending to three. He climbed onto the first step and then the second, bracing his hands against the side of the house to prevent the wobbly structure from\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 23 toppling. It was just high enough for him to raise his eyes over the windowsill and peer inside. Spread out before him was a large kitchen. A doorway at the back of the room appeared to lead deeper into the house. A cavernous wood-burning stove stood off to one side, and a fire glowed heartily in its iron belly. Split wood lay neatly stacked beside it in a sort of basket framed with wire and metal struts. There was a sink with a large white basin and an old-fashioned water pump mounted just above it. Shelves made of simple boards lined the far wall and held what looked like clay plates and cooking utensils. Against the far wall stood a tall wooden rack.  Inside the rack stood three towering scythes. The gleaming blades looked sharp enough to cleave a boy in two with one stroke. They were attached to thick wooden handles that stood easily twice as high as George. He doubted he would be strong enough to even lift one of those things, let alone wield it, and he estimated their length to be over six feet. The blades traced a thin curve along the wall like some murderous lunar shape, but what really made his heart pound was situated right in the middle of the room. Three huge men hunched over a round kitchen table. Their heads bowed inward so that he couldn't make out their faces, only their hunched backs and the black, wide-brimmed hats they wore. The most striking characteristic however, was their sheer size. Standing upright, they must have been at least seven feet, and the chairs they occupied could have accommodated four children George's size. He cocked his ear and got as close as he dared without coming into view through the window. He was surprised to find he could understand most of what they were\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 24 saying. The two giants on the far side of the table seemed to be listening intently, while the one with his back to the window spoke: \"Now look gentlemen, the instructions we received were crystal clear. Cruor has seen fit to place the exit portal near our house, a stupefying bit of good luck and a show of faith in us besides. Now's our chance to secure a real harvest for the first time in who knows how many years.\" One of the other men piped up: \"That's all well and good Daniel, but how much longer can we afford to wait? You know better than anyone that we can't afford to anger the king. Not after what happened last time. If we foul this up, our punishment will be ten times greater than the reward, which he may or may not deliver. I think we're taking a massive risk by getting involved at all.\" And the third: \"I agree with Cassius, but on the other hand, we need this. Desperately. We'll do what we've agreed to do: deliver the boy, unharmed, and that'll be the end of it. If anything should spiral beyond our control, I hardly think he'll blame us. Besides, if we don't take this chance, we could starve. Perhaps you've forgotten, but the drought this year has essentially brought the Realm to its knees. Barring Vladimir's mercy, we shall surely die right here on this land.\" \"A good point, Isaac, but you're insane if you think he'll be understanding of any... mix-ups,\" said the apparent leader, Daniel. \"We will await the boy, and when he appears, we shall remand him into our custody, deliver him to Vladimir, and there this... contract will end. And we do everything clean. You two may fail to realize this, but the situation in the Realm has been dire for some time. Without the boy, Vladimir's wouldn't think twice about starving the entire realm to death. I believe that.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 25 It dawned on George with sudden clarity that might be talking quite specifically about him. He felt a whisper of fear creeping around at the edge of his senses. Cassius spoke up again: \"All I'm saying is we've been waiting for hours and not so much as a field mouse has appeared. What if something went wrong? We all know what happened to the last group of farmers that blew an intake assignment.\" An involuntary shiver sputtered up George's spine, and his shoulders shook in a rapid undulation. To his horror, it was just enough to upset the delicate balance that he had attained on top of his crate tower.  The little staircase toppled without further warning. George flew backward and landed in the dirt, sending up a considerable cloud of dust. A couple of the wooden boxes bounced off the siding of the house with a loud clatter. A scraping of chairs and muffled voices immediately followed from within the kitchen. He was still recovering his wind and getting to his feet when he heard the rushed approach of their footsteps. George whirled around, knowing they were already upon him.  He was not wrong.  Three hulking figures stared at him from the corner of the house, about 20 feet away. Their expressions contained an odd mixture of surprise, relief, and fascination. In the dark, they appeared even more monstrous, and the largest of the three - Daniel, George remembered - stood a pace or two in front in a clear position of power. He eased toward him, the way a hunter might approach an animal in a trap. His hands were outstretched.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 26 Daniel clapped both mitts down on George's shoulders. He was too terrified to make a sound, let alone try and escape. It was far too late for that, anyway. His tongue had turned into what felt like a soggy, balled-up sock, and his knees rattled violently. The giant's companions - or brothers, as they appeared to be - stood behind him with their arms crossed, watching with leery interest. \"Well, well, well,\" Daniel said. \"What have we got ourselves here?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 27        CHAPTER 5  The rush of adrenaline seemed almost too much to bear, and Roger had to fight to stay conscious as he barreled through the cosmic wormhole. He felt his gorge start to rise and prayed that he wasn't about to puke all over the inside of the vortex.  The route began to slope away under Roger's legs, and he instinctively raked his fingers along the sides to try and slow his descent somehow. Unsurprisingly, this had no discernible effect, but he felt a curious rushing sensation not unlike dragging your fingers through water while cruising in a motorboat.  He had managed to keep his balance until now, but he got the distinct feeling that in another second or two he would lose control and start tumbling head over heels. Just when it seemed like he was about to start spinning at a terrifying speed, a massive stretch of barren land suddenly appeared below him. It was hard to say whether it held any beauty as the diorama continued to unfold and the blue matter of the vortex receded; speed blurred Roger's vision enough so that he couldn't make out much detail just yet. Just keep your eyes open, keep breathing, don't panic, he repeated to himself, but the tension was beginning to overwhelm his young mind and he started to panic, his\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 28 tears wicked away by the currents streaming over his body as he fell. He wasn't a coward, but he certainly didn't want to die, and if his young life ended here, who would ever find out about it? And what about George, for that matter? He pictured himself thudding down in the dust just inches from his own brother's corpse, which had lain there since the previous evening. It was a grim thought and Roger pushed it from his mind, but nevertheless sickening waves of panic had begun to sweep over him. All at once the tremendous speed of his descent began to taper off, and the danger of losing control seemed to pass for the moment. Instead, something billowy and soft pressed up against him from below, and he felt like he was sliding over the top of a very large parachute. There was nothing actually visible underneath, but the feeling of buoyancy was there all right. With a quick glance back over his shoulder, Roger realized that he had completely exited the sparkling blue vortex, and now fell freely through the open sky. The air tasted clean and refreshing in his lungs, and the sun shone brightly above the horizon to his left. With what little time he had to study the layout before landing, he saw a desolate dirt road rimmed by barbed wire that trailed off endlessly in both directions, and a large, old-fashioned farmhouse farther in the distance off a short access road. Black, rickety shutters created a sharp contrast against the dirty wooden siding of the house, and a somewhat crooked brick chimney stuck up from the roof like an unruly lick of hair. Beyond that, as far as he could tell, lay a field of some sort, but there was little he could make out beyond that with the huge house obstructing his view. That was all he had time to survey before he at last came to rest in the dust, not far from the road he had spotted. The current Roger had been floating on deposited him in the dirt, just as softly as if he had flown down on a magic carpet.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 29 He plopped down in a cloud of dust. Despite managing to land directly on the seat of his pants, there was no sharp jolt to his tailbone. He got up, dusted off the seat of his jeans, and took in his surroundings. Ahead stood the strange farmhouse with its raggedy shutters; he was definitely not crazy about the place's overall appearance. There were signs of decay and depreciation all over the building. He couldn't imagine who might live there, and wasn't sure he wanted to find out. The condition of the place held right in keeping with the rest of the scenery that now lay around him, which was, in a word, dusty. However, like the surrounding landscape, there was an underlying sense that perhaps it hadn't always looked this bad. The house in particular seemed as though it had probably once been a very nice place to live, but a lack of resources had caused it to fall somewhat into disrepair over the years. There was no color to the landscape except an all-encompassing golden-brown, the color of a freshly baked pie crust. It seemed like a place where water was perhaps a most valuable and precious commodity to its scattered residents. He was somehow unsurprised to see a pair of tumbleweeds rolling across the open prairie to my right, while a few lonely waves of dust spun up out of the ground behind them before scattering like big waves breaking on the seashore. He looked down the road and noticed a slight rise in the ground, just beyond what appeared to be a rickety gate. It consisted of nothing but a pole that sloped down to touch the ground at one end while resting in a taller, slingshot-shaped holder at the other end. The barbed wire turned in an abrupt right angle and bordered the rise in the ground. Train tracks, Roger thought at once, and he clasped George's toy train, which miraculously hadn't fallen out of his pocket during the journey through the portal.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 30 He set off towards the house. George was nowhere in sight, and he decided that if he had landed in the same spot, which he had a hunch George had, he would have headed for the house as well to look for help. Or, if he was simply struck with amazement by what happened after he jumped into the tree, he might just have wanted to explore. He wondered with trepidation what men or creatures could possibly inhabit such a ghoulish house. Roger would die before he let someone hurt his brother. # The house was only a little over two hundred yards from the place where Roger had first stood up to pat the dust off his pants, and he crossed the distance in under five minutes. When he got closer, he realized it was much bigger than originally thought, and three stories loomed overhead. The windows were dead, black eyes; the door like a mouth with a muzzle on it. Around the side he could see the edges of the field that he'd identified from his bird's-eye view. Dense wheat (or was it barley?) swayed in the wind, the frizzy tops undulating in long waves towards some low hills and the horizon beyond.  The image was calming, and a floaty feeling wafted through his mind that was not unlike deja vu. Was there anything familiar about this place at all though? None of it even seemed real. Roger was positive that he had no idea where he was and had never been here before, wherever or whatever \"here\" was, and this frightened him badly.  He made his way around to the right side of the house to get a better look at the field. In doing so, he happened upon a scattered pile of wooden crates. The air was hot and dry, much like the surrounding terrain, and he hoped whoever had bought the milk also had a cold place to keep it. This weather was definitely not early Maine\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 31 summertime. The parched landscape made it clear that this place hadn't seen rainfall in a very long time, and Roger suddenly realized he was very thirsty. Just above the pile of discarded crates he noticed a large window, made up of four outsized panes of dirty glass divided by thin white framing. The panes were not exactly the same size, and gave off the impression of a sort of dust-covered pinwheel. He could see no discernible activity from within, and decided to continue around the side of the house. Roger made his way around to the back, where he found himself gazing out over the immense, shimmering field. A lone crow flapped lazily into the air, rising from the rows like a puff of black smoke. What Roger had seen from the sky had been spectacular, and looking at it from the ground only served to enhance the impression. The field stretched on for what seemed like miles towards rolling hills in the distance. Though Roger realized later that discretion might have been a better policy, he thought it was possible that George had wandered out into the field. Not seeing another option, he cried out. \"Hello? George? Anybody out there?\" No sooner had his voice split the silence, than three enormous, bearded faces stuck up out of the swaying wheat with liquid speed. The figures stood a good distance away, though Roger could feel their gaze zoom in on him with terrifying awareness. They watched the small boy at the edge of the field for a minute longer. Roger was startled, but did not think they were dangerous at first glance. He decided to call out again. \"Um, hello, out there! I'm looking for my little brother, I think he's lost!\" he enunciated each word to make sure they heard him correctly.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 32 They turned inward, appearing to confer amongst themselves, and a second later started coming towards Roger in long strides that broke the even flow of the barley. They carried long-handled scythes over their beefy shoulders as though they weighed nothing. The blades glinted in the sun; they looked murderously sharp. The men were dressed in a style similar to what Roger remembered Vladimir Cruor wearing in the dream. Their overall appearance seemed a little more ragged, a little dirtier somehow than the dream figure's outfit, and a hard day's worth of sweat gleamed on their foreheads. It occurred to him that he could be dead wrong about the time of day, and that it was actually late afternoon as opposed to mid-morning. This thought only left him feeling even more disoriented than before. Black wide-brimmed hats adorned their heads, cocked at an angle that shaded their features like the gunslingers in an old Western movie. Thick tangles of black hair obscured their faces, as did the shadows from their hat brims. In spite of their somehow-familiar appearance - he wondered for an instant if he had ended up in some vaguely cult-like community, something like the Amish village where the boys had once stopped with their mother on a drive home from a trip to Pennsylvania - these men didn't exactly look like regular garden-variety human beings. They were enormous for one thing, at least eight feet tall and extremely burly. Could George have crossed paths with these giants, and if he had, would they have hurt him? Roger tried to shake off this possibility almost as quickly as it had entered his mind. For some reason they didn't look violent, but he thought that could have been akin to the way a grizzly bear looks fairly placid until it gets angry. His intuition told him they weren't a threat, but then again, he had very little on which to base such convictions. The scythe blades were mercifully clean, he noticed, but the giants could have easily\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 33 wiped them off  after they hacked my brother to pieces, a grim voice whispered in his head. He shuddered, and forced himself to banish such grim flights of fancy from his mind. He waited patiently by the edge of the field, feeling frozen with fear but at the same time confident that he could handle whatever challenge might lie ahead. These guys know something about George, and I'm going to find out what it is, he thought. The men came to the grassy strip that lay between the house and the field and stood at the edge, staring at Roger with eyes that looked as though they could swallow him up with their fierce fascination alone. Roger spoke in a shaky, hesitant voice: \"Um, excuse me, but I'm looking for my little brother. His name's George. Have you seen him? I think he might have come this way looking for help.\" He paused, thinking for a moment about how best to explain the situation. \"Also, where exactly am I?\" Despite the three workers' intimidating size, their body language soon seemed like nothing more than benign interest, and Roger relaxed a little in spite of himself. They leaned on the handles of their mowing implements, and the man in the middle - the one Roger assumed was the youngest - spoke up. His voice was deep and accented in a way that Roger imagined the English peasants in his daydream might have spoken. \"Slow down son, there'll be plenty of time for questions later. I think we'd better go inside and talk.\" He stepped forward, and Roger resisted the instinctive urge to retreat. \"Ah, but where are my manners! Please allow me to introduce myself: my name is Daniel and these...\" he made a sweeping gesture at the behemoths standing behind\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 34 him \"are my brothers, Cassius and Isaac.\" They each touched a finger to the brims of their hats in greeting, as though synchronized. Daniel shouldered his scythe once more and began to walk around towards the front of the house, motioning for Roger to follow. He did, and the two brothers marched dutifully behind them. Daniel took out a large loop of keys from his pocket, each one about the size of a serving fork, and unlocked the wide front door. Roger wondered briefly what the other keys might unlock as they stepped inside. The foursome made their way into a wide foyer, which was divided by a tremendous stairway. To their right stood an open doorway that led into the kitchen, and Cassius and Isaac went through and laid their scythes against the wall. They began to load chunks of split wood into an iron stove that was just visible beyond the entry way. Daniel placed a reassuring hand on the boy's shoulder. \"Mister,\" Roger started, \"I'd love to stay and all but I really need to find my brother. Have you seen him or not?\" His own boldness surprised him, but he decided the situation demanded it. \"No son, but let's step into the kitchen and we can talk it over.\" His booming voice ricocheted off the rafters and the floorboards. \"Well... all right,\" Roger conceded. Daniel led the boy inside and had him take a seat in a chair that was far too big for him. The round table was even further out of proportion to his thin frame. Cassius and Isaac finished loading the stove, which crackled pleasantly in the background. The giants' eyes twinkled and glistened  above their untamed beards. Roger's father, who had been clean-shaven all his life, would have chuckled at what he probably would have perceived as a lack of discipline in the self-grooming department.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 35 Roger and Daniel stared  across the table at one another. He was frantically trying to figure out whether these men were lying. They could be keeping him prisoner somewhere in this  house, for all I know, he thought, although somehow he doubted that was the precise truth. But perhaps it was not far off. \"Now then,\" Daniel said, \"you say you're looking for your brother, and he may be lost. What does he look like?\" His gaze seemed to convey both concern and sympathy. \"Well, when I last saw him, he was wearing a pair of red shorts and a pajama top.\" Cassius and Isaac joined them at the table. Roger thought a strange look flitted between them at his description, but he couldn't be sure. \"No, can't say we've seen anyone by that description. Is there anything else you can tell us about him?\" \"Like I said, his name is George, and I think he's lost. I followed him through the...\" he paused, trying to choose his words carefully. \"He disappeared and I'm pretty sure he came this way. Where could he have gone if he didn't come here?\" \"Now just a minute, where did you say you came from?\" Cassius asked. It was the first time he had spoken, and his voice quality and accent was almost identical to Daniel's. \"I came from... Maine,\" Roger said, not sure what else to say. \"Maine?\" Isaac asked, looking perplexed. \"Perhaps he means the Isle of Mayn, that little fishing village up by the Northern Rim,\" said Daniel.  \"Ah yes, I think we had an uncle who lived there for a few years,\" Isaac said, appearing reassured.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 36 \"No matter,\" said Daniel. \"The issue at hand is this young man's brother, who is lost, and possibly in danger. Isn't that right, young master... eh...\" \"Roger,\" he said, \"and who said anything about George being in danger?\" His heartbeat quickened. He was starting to feel ill at ease with these oversized gentlemen. \"Oh no, of course not, please don't misunderstand me my boy,\" said Daniel, backpedaling. \"But if he's lost, and you're out here trying to find him, it stands to reason that he needs our help, wouldn't you agree?\" \"Yeah, I guess that makes sense, sir,\" he agreed. Roger glanced out the window and noticed that the sun had begun to dip behind the horizon. He stifled a yawn and looked back at the brothers. He hadn't realized it up until that moment, but he was exhausted, not to mention incredibly sore for some reason. Must have been all that bouncing around on a cosmic waterslide. He had only been in this world for an hour at most, but the journey had had the strange effect of depleting almost all his energy. \"You must be exhausted. If you really came here from the Isle of Mayn - although, I'm not quite sure how you managed such a feat - then your journey must have been arduous. If you'd like, you can sleep in our guest room tonight, and tomorrow we'll discuss this further. We'll see what we can do about tracking down your missing brother.\" The thought of sleep appealed tremendously to him, and once more a yawn escaped his lips. \"I really need to find him,\" Roger protested. He grew drowsier by the minute. His body felt even more drained than it had a second ago.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 37 \"Of course, of course, but a young buck like yourself needs to save his strength! You get some rest, and I promise my brothers and I will do everything in our power to help you locate him... tomorrow,\" Daniel said with a finality that Roger found it difficult to argue with. \"Well ... if you say so,\" It occurred to him to ask them once again just where exactly he had ended up, but he was just too tired. This isn't normal, he thought feverishly. Something is very wrong here. Daniel took him by the hand, dwarfing it completely with his, and led Roger out of the kitchen and up the central staircase. There was a tiny bedroom at the end of a long hall, though it only seemed small when compared to the other living quarters that we passed on our way. The giant led him into a sparsely furnished bedroom. It reminded Roger of the rustic quarters in which he had found himself during the dream the previous night. There was a single bed stuck in the corner, and he saw a sprig of hay poking out from the bottom of the mattress. On top, they'd spread what looked like a very warm quilt. On the far wall stood a dresser and a mirror above it. The mirror had a hairline crack down the middle. The surface of the dresser was bare save for an oil lamp, which Daniel showed him how to use. The floorboards creaked under his considerable weight as he moved about the room, giving Roger the grand tour, which lasted all of a minute. It wouldn't occur to Roger until later how strange it was that they would have a room so much smaller than any other in the house, but at the time he was too exhausted to care. \"Well, I hope this suits you, Roger. We'll be downstairs for the time being if you need anything. Anything at all,\" he said. He whispered this last phrase in a tone that he probably meant to sound hospitable, but didn't quite make it.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 38 \"Sure Daniel, thanks,\" he managed, unable to keep his eyelids from drooping any longer. He staggered to the bed and collapsed on it face down, not even bothering to turn back the covers. He was out before my face hit the pillow. Daniel closed the door softly behind him, and was gone.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 39               CHAPTER 6  When Roger finally awoke, the room was black as pitch. His neck felt stiff, and a thin line of drool had just begun to leak out of his mouth before he woke up, already having formed a minor puddle on the pillow. He felt fine minus the stiff neck, and turned over onto his back, arriving at his senses and remembering where he was. He had an idea that George was in real trouble, and he tried to jog his brain out of its post-nap slumber. Roger swung his feet over the side of the bed, and spotted a sliver of light gleaming up through the cracks in the floorboards. It seemed as though his hosts had not retired yet, and were still in their kitchen. He could already hear the bubbly sounds of conversation, and as he crouched down, and the voices got louder, the words became intelligible. When he pressed his ear against the gap, they became clearer still. He listened intently. \"So what do you plan to do with him?\" said Isaac. His voice sounded hollow and muffled coming through the wooden crevice.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 40 \"This complicates things somewhat. The deal with Vladimir was for one boy, which we delivered as promised. He's in Vladimir's hands now, and our part is played,\" Daniel said. \"But don't you think he would be twice as pleased if we brought him a second child?\" said Cassius. Daniel paused. \"I suppose you may have a point, brother. Vladimir could reward us doubly for such... exemplary work.\"  \"Exactly as I was thinking,\" Isaac said. \"Without his help, we could go hungry. This has been, as you know, an exceedingly dry year, and if Vladimir doesn't help us turn things around, I just don't know...\" he trailed off. \"The Harvest could be a disaster.\" \"Believe me, I'm aware of that,\" Daniel said. \"You have a point. We certainly want to tread lightly here,\" Isaac conceded. \"If we handle this... development... improperly, we might incur his wrath. If he decides to punish us rather than reward us, we'd find our lives in serious danger,\" Cassius added. Daniel did not speak, and seemed to be considering this last point carefully. My ear had grown numb from being pressed so hard against the bedroom floor. \"Right again, my brothers. We must try to look at this from every angle. There's no question that this could benefit us immensely if we play our cards right.\" \"So what do you propose, Daniel?\" Cassius said. \"No need to frighten the boy any more than we have to. We'll let him sleep, and then in the morning we'll deliver him to Vladimir and let him sort this mess out. His orders were to deliver one heir, but we're going to give him two. I'm sure he can think of\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 41 some use for the new child. And once they are both in Vladimir's care... escape will be out of the question.\" Roger didn't like the sound of this one bit. His heart had begun to thud rapidly as he realized where they planned to take him. \"For once, I find myself in complete agreement,\" said Cassius. \"We'll hitch up the wagon and bring him along to Vladimir at first light. There our involvement shall end, and we will most assuredly have our harvest. His highness will be very pleased, I have no doubt. This may be the opportunity to prove ourselves we've been waiting for.\" \"Very good gentlemen, I think the matter is settled. Any last thoughts, brother Isaac?\" said Daniel with the formal efficiency of a politician. \"I think we're pushing our luck if we wait until morning. I'd be in favor of taking him right now.\" \"And tip the boy off that something is wrong, and reveal that we have no intention of helping him rescue his brother?\" Cassius said. \"On the contrary, all we'd have to say is we've just received news regarding his brother's whereabouts, and we consider it our responsibility to reunite them forthright,\" Isaac mused. \"It wouldn't necessarily be a lie, and he did seem eager to act as quickly as possible. He might go along with it quite willingly, I think.\"  Daniel said, \"No, we'll wait until morning. We simply do not want to risk scaring him - he could jump off the wagon and make a dash for freedom for all we know. And what then? If he ran off into the night, we might find it... challenging... to bring him back in one piece. You know well enough that the local wildlife can be rather ferocious this time of year. Have you forgotten what happened to the child who showed up five harvests back claiming to be from some strange land called 'O-hi-o'? The one who went\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 42 outside to relieve himself an hour after we'd put him to sleep? His bones - those we could find, anyway - were strewn about our field for yards. He never even stood a chance.\" A shiver of fear ran up Roger's spine. Local wildlife? If he stuck around until morning, they would take him to George all right - and Vladimir Cruor, apparently - but as a helpless captive. Roger doubted he'd get another chance to escape if he didn't leave that night. He stroked the Barlow knife in his pocket, and prayed it would be enough to protect him if there ever came a need. He unglued his ear from the floor and looked around. The window above his bed had an old-fashioned clasp that he was able to unlatch, allowing him to push the window open on its hinges and create a space about a foot wide. Plenty of room for a young boy to squeeze through. He dragged the sheets off the bed and began to tie a rope ladder with knots for footholds. The brothers' muted chatter continued in the kitchen below. Roger only had two medium-sized cotton sheets at his disposal, but they were sturdy enough, and once he tied them together they formed a usable length of about 20 feet. He lashed one end to the bedpost - the frame must have weighed a ton, judging from the huge beams they'd used to build it, and refused to budge an inch when he tested it with a few hearty tugs - and threaded the other end through the window. It fluttered down through the night air and stopped short about five feet off the ground. He heard the squeak of chairs being pushed back from the table as the giants wrapped up their discussion. Roger knew he had to act fast. Strapping his backpack tight around his shoulders, he wriggled out feet first while gripping the window sill with white-knuckled fingers. He climbed down the rope ladder as fast as he could, dropping through the air for the remaining five feet at the bottom.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 43 He was free. # A wave of deja vu hit him as he recalled how he'd landed after traveling through the vortex. The air was quiet around him. He stood listening for a moment or two longer, making sure that no signs of stirring elicited from the sleeping house. He felt like he'd stepped out of a spaceship and onto the surface of the moon - impossibly far from home, and alone. Roger decided to set out towards the train tracks. He glanced around, straining his ears for any sounds of approaching danger. He hadn't liked that remark about the 'local wildlife' one bit, and it was starting to dawn on him that leaving the house might not have been the wisest course of action. But what choice do I have? he thought. The brothers had already taken him prisoner, they just hadn't admitted it yet. If he had let it get to that point of no return, then all hope of rescuing George would have vanished. He desperately wished he could go back in time and prevent George from coming here. Why would he have entered the portal without telling me? Did something force him to go through? Roger thought. He remembered the sucking feeling that had seemed to tug at his forehead in the dream as he'd stood there staring in, a hypnotic sensation that he had little power to control. He skirted the barbed wire fence by jogging up the narrow access path that connected the farmhouse to the main road, which he then followed all the way to the slight rise that he had spotted earlier. Beyond there were indeed train tracks; gleaming rungs of steel that went on infinitely in both directions, built on thick wooden railroad ties that looked almost new. These were not the dilapidated, overgrown railroad ties that\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 44 he and George used to walk along near the old soccer fields a couple miles from their house; these were modern tracks that almost certainly saw regular use. He realized that he had no idea which direction he should head in. Somewhere in the distance a wolf howled - or perhaps something far more sinister. In truth he had no idea what might be lurking out there on the dark prairie, waiting to leap out and tear him limb from limb with snapping, drooling jaws. He pulled his thin shirt tighter around my shoulders and pressed on. He remembered a trick he had seen in an old movie, and bent down to feel the rails. To Roger's surprise, he immediately detected a tiny rumble that began to grow. It was barely perceptible at first, but the unmistakable tremble under his fingers steadily increased. He looked up, away from the house, and sure enough a luminescent white orb was streaking towards him, piercing the darkness. Now, he could just make out a smoke stack, which belched plumes of used-up coal into the air, where the black cloud then threaded backwards as the locomotive made its way around a bend in the track. It was the type of train that hadn't seen wide us on Earth for about 80 years. An old-fashioned cow-catcher protruded from the front, and a large red star gleamed on the front of the engine. Roger estimated that it would reach his present location in under two minutes, and there was no way he was going to miss a ride out of here. Glancing back over his shoulder, he checked the house of Daniel, Cassius, and Isaac for any signs of activity, or discovery of his escape. To his chagrin, a light flickered on upstairs right as he looked. Based on what he could remember of the house's layout, the light appeared to be in the bedroom he'd recently vacated, and he could just make out one enormous shadow moving about behind the curtain. The curtain abruptly rose,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 45 and there stood Daniel, clearly framed in the lit window. He flung the curtain back in anger, and then stormed off to alert Isaac and Cassius of Roger's escape. The train chugged closer. Roger got into a ready position, preparing to run alongside the train and leap aboard when he got his chance. In spite of his distance from the house, and the loudening thunder of the train, he could hear the sound of heavy boots stomping down wooden steps not two hundred yards from where he stood. Soon they would emerge into the courtyard. The train was getting closer, and suddenly the brothers whirled into view, running full tilt around the side of the house. Their scythes gleamed dully in the moonlight. To Roger's amazement, the train suddenly began to slow down as soon as it got near him. He ran, but a gentle wind had arisen around my feet, twirling into a minor dust devil that appeared to grow larger with every second. The stars seemed to twinkle even brighter in spite of the overwhelming beam of light coming from the train.  He increased his trot to a full-on gallop. His legs pumped up and down in time with the train's steady rhythm. It was not as difficult as he had imagined to keep pace, but the slight ridge that lifted the tracks up above the surrounding plains would make it complicated to jump into an open boxcar, though he could see several with gaping bays. Roger reached up with his left hand, but the jouncing backpack had begun to wear him out. He could feel his endurance slowly ebbing away, and tried to recall the last time he and George had had a decent foot race. Usually he'd be up for this sort of dash, and back home he had hoped to try out for middle school soccer in the fall, but some residual exhaustion from the journey hampered his efforts. His muscles had begun to feel like jelly; his bones were the toast.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 46 Meanwhile, the cyclone that had swirled up around his feet grew more powerful, and kept pace with him step for step. It was then that Roger felt the soles of my shoes lift off the ground. One minute he was running as fast as his young legs could carry him, the next he was sprinting through thin air, a look of bewilderment and surprise plastered all over his face. Before Roger could even process what was happening, and too frightened to stop running lest the miniature tornado drop him, he found himself level with the opening of an open boxcar, which had JEBEDIAH'S COAL painted in gaudy white letters on its blood-red sidewall. His legs chugged through the air, faster and faster until he thought his lungs might burst, wondering how long the miniature twister that buoyed him through the air would last. The railcars forged ahead alongside with bone-rattling momentum. He knew it was now or never. Roger twisted his body sideways, and with a final burst of strength, he hurled himself into the open boxcar. # Roger collapsed in a heap on the dusty wooden floor. The scent of sawdust greeted him, and he looked around to try and get his bearings. The locomotive sped along through the night. He listened carefully, but the only thing his ears could detect was the low rumble of the train's wheels. Roger thought he had eluded the clutches of Daniel and his gargantuan brothers, but what might be lurking here in the dark recesses of the boxcar? He squinted into the darkness, imagining dripping fangs and twinkling eyes where the starlight glinted at the corners of his vision. [You're all right son, there's nothing to be afraid of in here.]\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 47 Roger stopped moving and held his breath. Did I really just hear that? A voice had filtered into his head just as clearly as if someone had spoken out loud. As if to confirm his fears, he heard a scratching on the wooden floorboards that almost sounded like fingernails dragging over a chalkboard. A tapping, too, came out of the gloom, like the talon of a monster drumming away as he impatiently awaiting his supper. The scratching came closer. \"Easy child, I won't hurt you. You were movin' at a mighty gallop when you finally tumbled in here. I'm sure whatever was after ya gave up the chase by now.\" Stepping out of the shadows with its head cocked to one side was a small black raven, its feathers shiny and sleek like fine Indian ink. Roger's jaw dropped. \"What the...?\" he stammered. \"Not from around here, that's plain to see! And what were you doing running around the plains at night?\" His beak moved in motions that matched up with the words coming from his mouth in what might have been called a country caw, if birds were known to have accents. \"Don't you know the prairie wolves would lick your bones clean if they ever caught up with you?\" he asked. \"I... I'm not from here, I'm lost. I need to find my brother, I think he might be in trouble.\" He couldn't believe it. He was actually having a conversation with a crow. Stranger things had been happening lately, granted, but the appearance of an intelligent bird had surpassed anything he might have been prepared for. \"Those men were going to take me to see a man called Vladimir Cruor. I think he took my brother prisoner.\" Roger's new acquaintance fluffed his wings with what appeared to be indignation. \"That old lout? Mucking up matters in the Realm, that's about the long and short of\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 48 what he's good for. Never seen a lick of decency or good work out of him in all my years of livin'. And he played me a nasty old trick, too, oh yes he did.\" \"You know him?\" Roger asked. \"Of course I do, he rules this land! Runs the show with an iron fist when you get right down to it. All the folks livin' here better do what he say, otherwise they're apt to lose a year's worth of harvestin'. There are things a sight worse than that, too, he's been known to bring about, that is, in times of wrath, as they say. He and I have a ... personal connection, too.\" He looked down at his scaled feet mournfully. \"He's the reason I ride this old tin box, if you want to know the truth of it.\" \"I'm sorry, but who are you?\" He was starting - just barely - to get used to the idea of conversing with a bird. \"Oh, where are my manners, forgot to introduce myself. My name is Percival Crawston the Third, but you can call me Percy.\" He extended a wingtip. \"Pleased to make your acquaintance.\" Roger gingerly took one feather in his thumb and forefinger and gave it a brief shake. The feathers felt smooth and oily. \"Well, I'm Roger,\" he said, finding his voice at last. His throat had gone decidedly dry in the last two minutes since the conversation had begun. \"I honestly have no idea where I am. You said 'the Realm'? What is that?\" \"Child, you really aren't from around here, are ya? The Realm is here! It's everywhere! No one knows just how far the borders stretch out but I'll tell you, this place is enormous. You can just keep on walking forever and you'll never see the same thing twice.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 49 \"Aren't we on like... a foreign planet? If you walked long enough wouldn't you come around the other side and end up back where you started?\" \"Heavens no, where'd you get such an idea?\" Percy had folded his legs beneath him and now sat almost like a duck on the wooden floor. Roger had never seen a bird looking quite so... civilized. He imagined him donning a bowler and smoking a corncob pipe. He decided to join him on the floor, crossing his legs beneath him Indian-style. \"The Realm doesn't circle around, it just ... stretches out. Forever,\" Percy said. \"Oh...\" \"So you think Vladimir Cruor has your brother?\" Roger brightened at their return to the topic of George. This bird knows something that can help me, and I'm going to find out what it is, he thought. Percy cocked his head at the boy once again. \"I'm almost positive. The men whose house I was at before... they put me in a bedroom and left me to sleep, but I could hear their conversation through the floorboards. They said they were gonna bring me there too, I think.\" \"Well it's a damn good thing you got out of there. I think I know the men you mean - not the most pleasant of types, all brawn and no brains, but they sure know how to swing a scythe. That'd be Daniel Grimsrud and his two brothers. Mother was a giant, father an ogre, had three boys. They sure grew up to be big,\" he paused, \"and hairy!\" \"Tell me more about Vladimir Cruor,\" Roger pressed. \"The brothers said he wants to keep us here. I climbed out the window before I could hear much more, but I remember one thing - they used the word 'heir' when they were talking about us. I don't think they know me and George are brothers, but I'm pretty sure they don't want to let us go home.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 50 \"You sure they weren't talking about the air? Sounds the same, heir, air.\" A look of consternation had worked its way into Percy's facial features. \"This might be worse than we thought.\" \"I know what they said.\" \"Of course, don't mean to be contrary. Hmm. This is a puzzle indeed, what to do, what to do...\" He got up and began to pace in little circles. The train's course remained straight as an arrow. Roger felt decidedly out-of-whack, however, and began to doubt his ability to continue the conversation. Everything he thought he knew about reality was coming unstuck at the seams. Stay focused. You need information, and he could even become some kind of ally. You need all the help you can get. \"You said you're stuck on this train because of something Vladimir did, right?\" he asked. Percy stopped pacing and looked up. \"What's that? Oh yes, I do indeed, ever since he stripped me of my license to fly, sonny. That old bastard played me a real nasty trick when he clipped my wings.\" He blinked. \"'Scuse the rough language there, pal, forgot to mind my manners.\" Roger paid no mind. \"So you can't fly? Vladimir took away your ability to fly, is that it?\" He wiped a sweaty palm across his forehead. \"Why would he do such a thing?\" \"He decided he had to punish me,\" Percy said. \"Because of one stupid little mistake, he took away the greatest gift I ever had.\" He now wore an expression that reminded Roger of his dad's face when he was hankering for a puff of pipe tobacco and a cold beer after a long day at the office. Percy went on: \"I used to be able to soar all around the Realm, go anyplace I wanted to. Those days are gone now - but there's\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 51 something I can do about it!\" He perked up. \"An old woman named Mother Florence. I'm going to see her. She has a campsite not far from here and I know she can help. She might even know how to get your brother back, too,\" he said. \"Mother Florence?\" \"Yes, very wise, very wise indeed,\" Percy muttered, beginning to pace in those frantic little circles once more. \"She'll know just what to do about your brother, no doubt about it, and as for me...\" the starlight glinted in his eyes, black as polished buttons. \"I plan on getting my wings back.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 52               CHAPTER 7  The old king sat at the head of a long table, drumming his fingers impatiently. Daniel, Cassius, and Isaac stood before him in the great dining hall, which also served as Vladimir Cruor's receiving chamber when there were serious conversations to be had. The candelabra at the center of the table sent flickers dancing across the stone wall. The scent of roasting meat floated in from the kitchen, which lay behind a smaller door to the rear. Daniel licked his lips. He was flanked by his two brothers. They waited patiently for Vladimir to speak. Isaac and Cassius looked utterly distraught. Vladimir could execute them on the spot, if he wanted to. Daniel knew that Isaac had seen the boy running alongside that train, and it stood to reason that he had made it aboard safely. By then he could be anywhere. Of course, the boy knew nothing about the geography of the Realm. Another lost boy, another tragedy in the making, perhaps one that had already occurred. How many times had the master brought children through, only to have it end in disaster? Daniel wondered. And who knew what Vladimir Cruor really wanted with these two little boys. The king worked in mysterious ways.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 53 \"How could you let him get away?\" Vladimir suddenly bellowed. \"That boy was the right one! He's the one I want! First you show up with the wrong brother, and now here you are telling me that this other child - Roger, you say - was in your house... AND YOU LET HIM CLIMB OUT THE WINDOW?!\" \"Sir, in all honesty, there was no way he could have known our intention was to bring him to you, or that his brother was being held here.\" Cassius says. Daniel shot him a withering look. The wrong choice of words could get them killed. Cassius gave a barely perceptible shrug in return. \"When I want you to speak, I'll ask you a direct question.\" The words dripped from the king's tongue like poison. Daniel resisted the urge to flinch as Vladimir aimed his gaze directly at him. No one dared to point out the fact that Vladimir had asked a question just prior to Cassius's protest. \"Daniel, this was your job. You should know I'm holding you lot fully responsible. I thought you had some sense in you, but when the three of you work together, you become just as incompetent as a gaggle of lobotomized geese.\" Daniel's skin prickled with indignation at Vladimir's callous, ignorant words. He wanted to raise his voice and tell the king he had no right to speak to them that way, perhaps seize him by his wrinkled old throat and shake him until his long, hated life drained away forever, thereby freeing the Realm and giving people a real chance to live their lives in harmony... but no, they weren't strong enough. Talking back would mean a sure death for all three of them. It was not safe to let his mind wander along such lines - one never knew who could 'overhear' such thoughts.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 54 \"We live only to serve you,\" Daniel heard himself say. It was like watching someone else acting out a role on stage. \"Please tell us how we may atone for this act of carelessness.\" This appeared to placate him, but the impression was only temporary. Daniel knew he could not completely assuage Vladimir Cruor's infamous temper with such a plain and simple apology. \"It's too late,\" Vladimir waved a hand with disgust. \"This is not the first time that the Grimsrud clan has failed me, Daniel, though I fully intend for it to be the last. \"I'm calling in the Rangers. They used to say, 'if you want something done right, you must do it yourself.' Wise words, but I have a saying that I think you'll appreciate too: if you don't want something fouled up all to hell, you must call the Rangers to finish the job. I should have assigned this task to them in the first place.\" Vladimir grimaced, as if experiencing sudden heart pain. If you are, I hope it hurts, you old bastard, Daniel thought. The other voice in his brain chastised him again for not keeping his thoughts in line. You think no one in this house can read your mind and report it to Vladimir? the voice said. \"The Rangers, sir? I thought you wanted the boy unharmed.\" Cassius, speaking out of turn again. Daniel winced and hoped that the implication did not transform Vladimir Cruor into a whirling dervish of rage once more. \"I want him brought to me you fools!\" He slammed his fist down on the oaken table, the thud adding to the cacophony of his voice now bouncing around the airy chamber. \"The longer he's out there, the better the odds that he'll get snapped up by some roving pack of wolves.\" He paused. \"You might also be interested to know that that troublesome crow Percy inhabits an old freight train that goes by your place, and I'm\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 55 almost certain Roger boarded it after he slipped through your fingers. For all we know, they could be on their way to see Mother Florence right now.\" \"Mother Florence, sir? I thought she was just a myth,\" Daniel said. Vladimir shot him a look that could curdle milk. \"That bitch is no myth,\" he said, drawing out each word. \"She is real, and sits out there at her camp with those two brats, scheming and plotting against me constantly. You can only find her if she wants to be found - or, if you track someone whom she has allowed to approach. For that reason she has managed to stay just out of reach all these years. Every scout I've sent to determine her location has ended up going mad. When they came back - those that stayed sane long enough to return, anyway - the Rangers had no choice but to put them down like rabid dogs.\" He looked as though he had tasted something sour. \"I'd like nothing better than to see her behind bars, locked in my dungeon for the next hundred years or so.\" Mother Florence. The name conjured up images of Daniel's childhood, his own enormous ma balancing him on one tree-trunk thigh, telling the tales of an ancient woman who lived on the plains, caring for her two children, Hector and Maisie. She had told him about her great talents, as she called them. The ability to read minds, and, in some cases, predict the future. Vladimir glared at them now, his eyes full of unfiltered hatred. \"Well, what are you waiting for, an invitation? I'm done with you. Get the hell out of here!\" Isaac opened his mouth to protest, or perhaps to ask for one more chance, but he knew it was a bad idea. Without Vladimir's help, the Harvest would be lost; this was the reality all three of them faced. A sudden urge to walk up to the table and spit viciously upon the wood in defiance threatened to overwhelm Daniel. Vladimir noticed Isaac's\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 56 desire to add something, and even more vitriol seeped into his expression. His skin had taken on a decidedly angry red hue, and Daniel half-expected steam to billow from his ears at any second. \"Get out of my sight!\" he screamed. Daniel blinked as a few tiny flecks of spittle flew from Vladimir's mouth. Without another word, the brothers Grimsrud turned to leave. # The dungeon was cold, but not uncomfortably so. The air felt refreshing on George's skin and in his lungs, and the aroma of hay teased at his nose. He could hear dripping water somewhere over by the darkened stairwell. He imagined the tiny splash it made as the droplets formed a little puddle, perhaps draining off into some crack or flaw in the floor until it returned to the ground deep below the foundations of this house. He tried to stop his knees from shaking, with little success. A short while ago he'd heard the distinctive stamp of heavy boots upstairs, probably in that dining hall where the men had brought him when they'd first arrived, he thought, but he could have been wrong. George's understanding of the house's layout was disjointed at best, but he had gotten a good look at the entrance hall, which was shrouded in woven tapestries of brilliant color and design, and lit by massive torches on the walls that reminded him of the movie Dracula, which he and Roger had secretly watched when they were younger, without their dad's permission. George had nothing to do except listen to the water drip, and he realized he had started to cry. The prickly sensation in his eyes had given way to a few tears, which rolled down his smooth cheeks and plunged to the ground with the same patter as the drops in the stairway.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 57 The sudden sound of a large metallic bolt sliding out of place interrupted his troubled thoughts. Ancient hinges at the top of the stairs groaned in protest as the door opened, and a visitor's shoes rasped on the steps as he - or it - descended to the row of cells. \"Hello?\" George called out, feeling some strange burst of confidence as he found his voice. \"Is somebody there?\" He realized that he missed Roger almost more than he missed home, freedom, or his dad. The tears began to roll faster as he played over various terrible fates that would likely await him a few hours from now, perhaps at the hands of some hooded executioner. \"Calm down boy, don't get yourself in a tizzy, I'm only coming 'round to have a quick word.\" George didn't recognize the voice, though the accent sounded vaguely familiar. Presently a man drew into view, one who walked with a rather large kink in his spine. It jutted into the air like a cat's arched back, and his crooked shoulders framed a pinched old face that was speckled with warts. He clutched a cane in one hand, while the other held a glowing lantern aloft. George watched him approach with a knotted fist of trepidation twisting its way into his stomach. A flicker of light from the lantern glinted off his teeth. They looked sharp. He approached the George's cell in shuffling, lurching steps, a cane clacking down for assurance as he made his way closer. He figured my best course of action would be to sit still and wait. He walked up to the bars of the cell and stood there, staring in with wide, searching eyes. He squinted and held his lantern a little higher, trying to get a better look at the boy. George, in turn, took a couple steps backwards; there was a rotten smell coming off the man in waves.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 58 \"Now look here, sonny jim, I don't mean to scare you. The old man upstairs just wants to have a word with ya, explain why you're here and that sort of thing. I'm sure you've got a handful of questions, ain't ya?\" he spoke with a mild-mannered politeness that surprisingly made George feel a bit more at ease. \"He knows he's got a bit of explainin' to do. Come on, let me getcha out of that cell there.\" He reached for a large ring of keys hooked to one of his belt loops. George had no desire to go upstairs, but the prospect of getting out of the cell for the time being certainly held its appeal. The key clanged in the lock and the door yawned open. The figure stood before him, looking down at George the way a lion might look at a trapped gazelle. \"Who are you?\" he pleaded. \"I don't know where I am and I want to go home. My big brother, Roger... he'll be looking for me!\" \"Goodness me, where are my manners! Forgot to introduce m'self. Name's Mandrake. Lord Cruor entrusts me with only the most sensitive matters, but don't think of me as a jailor, little fellow; I'm more of a caretaker, and I keep the place looking pretty spiffy if I do say so myself.\" George didn't care about any of that. What he wanted to know was how long he'd have to wait before being reunited with his family. \"Why am I locked up here? I didn't do anything wrong,\" George said, trying to sound as convincing as possible. \"All in good time. But first, let me escort you upstairs. The man we're about to see doesn't like to be kept waiting.\" Perhaps the last thing in the world that George wanted at that moment was to see \"The Man Upstairs\", but he figured he had little choice in the matter. He stepped out of the cell with his head down until he was standing beside Mandrake.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 59 \"There's a good sport! I promise you'll be very interested to hear what he has to say,\" he wheezed.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 60               CHAPTER 8  Two gunmen on pale white horses crested a low hill that overlooked an endless dusty plain that stretched out below. Pearl-handled revolvers stuck out of hand-stitched holsters embroidered with gold thread by the shamans of a gun-loving tribe of nomads who frequented the prairies to the north. The trim on their leather chaps bounced in time with their horses cantor as they drew to a stop. For all intents and purposes, they were identical in appearance, and one could have sworn they were twins. \"I reckon if we ride all day we'll make it to the Cruor estate by sundown,\" the first rider remarked, studying a scuffed patch on his leather riding gloves. The other man looked up, silently assessing the sun's position in the bright blue sky. \"Aye, we've got an early start. Good thing the summons came when it did.\" \"Sounds like those three yokels really screwed the pooch this time.\" \"You could say that.\" \"Think Vladimir'll pay us good this time?\" \"I don't know Martin, you know he can never make up his mind this far in advance. We'll see how our fortunes sway with the task at hand, then worry about\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 61 compensation later.\" He paused, then added: \"I swear you have a one-track mind sometimes.\" \"Ah just think we ought to receive our dues, is that so wrong?\" \"Naw, it's a fair point, brother, fair point.\" The rider named Martin leaned over in his saddle and spat a healthy dollop of tobacco juice onto the ground. \"Well, I s'pose it's not as if we have a whole lot of choice in the matter, anyhow,\" he said. \"We'd better get a move-on.\" They each gave their steeds a jolting kick in the ribs with matching spurs and were away. The hooves of their white horses sent up a massive cloud of dust as the descended the bluff and streaked out across the prairie like white lightning.   # \"Step this way son, and watch your feet, these stairs can be treacherous,\" Mandrake said as he aimed the lantern towards the top of the dungeon steps. \"You'll pardon the master for keeping you waiting.\" He stopped and turned to look at George with an embarrassed expression. \"By the way, young sir, er... what do they call you in the land you come from?\" he asked. \"George,\" he said. \"My name is George.\" The pronunciation of his own name sounded almost alien since he hadn't said it aloud in so long, but at the same time it instilled a little more self-confidence somehow. He doubted that what \"the master\" wanted to show him would placate his frazzled nerves, but he went willingly enough. Mandrake guided him down a narrow\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 62 hallway that led to another side door. This one opened into the great dining hall that he had briefly glimpsed upon arrival. A fire roared in the hearth, and an imposing figure sat at the head of the long oaken table. It looked to George like he spent a lot of time at that post. He looked as comfortable in that carved, high-back chair as a snake wrapped around a mangrove branch. \"Well if it isn't my newest star pupil!\" the man said in a booming voice. When George met his eyes for that first time, he noticed that the expression on his face actually made him seem anxious to meet the boy, as though some great hope rested on his shoulders. Mandrake stood George at attention on the other side of the table, then hurried over to the old man and whispered something in his ear. \"George, of course! Good English name. Take a seat, if you like. Now, do you know who I am?\" George opted to tuck himself into a smaller chair at the corner of the table, unconsciously choosing one that would minimize eye contact. In his heart, he already had a glimmer of an idea as to who he was, couldn't quite put a finger on it. \"No... I'm not sure, I guess.\" He chuckled, as though George had just told some childish joke. \"That's very good, boy, plenty of time for introductions after all. They call me Vladimir Cruor,\" he said. \"You're probably wondering why I've brought you here, and the truth is we had a little bit of a mix-up. You see, the real goal was for me to meet your brother. I think we both know that he's already made his way to the Realm and is on his way here to rescue you at this very moment. Isn't that right, George?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 63 George had no idea that Roger had in fact come through the tree in search of him, but he fervently hoped that Vladimir was telling the truth. \"What do you want from me?\" he asked hesitantly. It seemed like a reasonable enough question. \"Now now, it's not what I want from you...\" he intoned, smiling at George with red, cracked lips. \"We're in this together here, don't you see? One team, you and me, same side.\" \"Then why can't I go home? This place is scary.\" Vladimir laughed. \"You'll need some time to fully adjust, but let me be the first to tell you, this is your home now! You've yet to see just how wonderful the Realm can be. In fact, there's something that I've been meaning to show you.\" \"What is it?\" he asked, curious enough. \"It's in my study. Mandrake, would you kindly take leave of us for a while?\" Mandrake obediently slipped out of a side-door and was gone. Vladimir himself got up with a slight wheeze and motioned for the little boy to follow. He did so. They walked side by side to the back of the room, then descended through an opening down a stone staircase that led to another chamber, this one a round room that appeared to be part of some kind of tower at the center of the house. In truth he hadn't gotten a great look at the exterior of the building, but he knew full well that the structure this man called home was enormous. He wouldn't have been the least bit surprised to know that they were in fact standing inside the base of a tower that shot up through the center of the mansion like some kind of taproot. George's one and only impression up to that point had been that the place was like a castle. One thought kept pecking at his brain: What have I gotten myself into, and will I ever see my brother and my dad again?\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 64 \"Step this way, son, don't be frightened.\" Without another word, Vladimir yanked on a torch holder in one wall, and the stone panel began to separate, spreading apart right before their very eyes. The pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, but the lines had been almost invisible prior to Vladimir pulling on the lever. The tall man looked on with mild interest as though he had done it a thousand times. Of course, George had never seen anything like this mechanism in his entire life, and was dumbstruck. He hardly even registered his gnarled hand on my shoulder as he gently pushed him forward, urging him to go inside and see what lay in store. \"Don't be frightened,\" Vladimir said. George again found himself without many options to choose from, and moved forward into the opening. As soon as he crossed the threshold, he felt the temperature increase a good ten degrees or so. Just when he was starting to worry about finding my way in the dark, a green orb of light seemed to ooze into luminescence and guide my footsteps along the cobblestone floor. George proceeded forward with some faint semblance of confidence, if only from the fact that he could see where he was going. Vladimir followed close behind. As it turned out, the orb that guided him emanated from a pool of the same green light. Whether it was actually water or some other liquid was anyone's guess. The pool was contained in a sort of well that he had never seen before, one that was almost certainly man-made, but nonetheless looked as though it had formed quite naturally, almost like a birdbath fashioned from an extraordinarily thick stalagmite through thousands of years of water dripping straight down from above.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 65 Vladimir approached the glowing pool. He bent slightly at the waist to twirl its contents with one long, bony index finger. George decided that it was most definitely not water when he saw how viscous it was. Sparkling globules of the stuff clung to Vladimir's finger, then dribbled back into the basin with a heavy plop when he withdrew his hand and gave it a brisk shake. The chamber was completely unfurnished save for the glowing urn in the center. \"Come closer, my son. Look into these waters. They'll show you anything you want to see... if you know how to look.\" George walked up to the edge as if in a trance and peered inside. Vladimir swirled his finger on the surface once more, and no sooner had he done so than an image appeared on the top of the liquid, clear as day and sharper than any picture George had ever seen on TV. It looked like an old-fashioned locomotive, rumbling along through a prairie. \"I've already ascertained the whereabouts of your brother, George. Those nice men who brought you here saw him board this train, which is now headed more or less in our general direction. If he stays on its current course, he'll arrive at our doorstep by sundown. Pretty convenient, wouldn't you say?\" George's heart leapt into his throat. \"You're going to throw him in the dungeon too, aren't you?!\" he half-shouted, adrenaline and fear coursing through my veins. \"Heavens no! He'll stay with us, granted, but I'll make sure that you're moved into rooms that should be more suitable for growing boys. This mansion holds many beautiful chambers, and you're welcome to the one of your choosing. There are just some... preliminary precautions we're forced to take, purely in order to ensure your\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 66 safety, you see. That's why we're having you stay in the basement suites for now!\" He flashed a winning smile. \"It's a dungeon,\" George stated flatly in protest. \"Enough.\" There was an edge to the old man's voice now. \"Think of it as a temporary relocation zone.\" He paused and motioned towards the fluid image in the astral birdbath. \"You see now how your brother has already made friends with a very unsavory character?\" He had plenty more to say, but bit the words off cleanly before they came out and focused on the projection instead. Sure enough, the image had moved closer until it was now flying in tandem right alongside the train, looking in on the open doors of a certain boxcar with the words JEBEDIAH'S COAL painted on the side. George was almost unsurprised to see Roger himself sitting in the opening of the boxcar, his legs dangling over the side with that unmistakable carelessness that so often seemed to characterize my big brother. \"That's Roger!\" he exclaimed, too glad to see him to contain his excitement. \"It certainly is,\" Vladimir replied, returning to a more pleasant tone. \"I'm afraid he's taken up with a talking crow named Percy, who has plagued this region for more years than I'd care to admit. I'll be honest with you, George: I'm a little disappointed in your brother's choice of friends.\" He leered at him with a sinister grin. \"Very disappointed indeed.\" \"A crow?\" George asked. \"Yes, a crow. And a very clever, treacherous crow at that. Once Roger joins us, we'll have to separate them. It'll be for his own good.\" Now Vladimir hardly seemed to be addressing him at all, off in some personal world where his own musings took\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 67 precedence over everything else. \"It's just as I suspected. I believe they're trying to see Mother Florence. Another minor problem, to be sure, and one that can easily be remedied.\" He turned back to George. \"I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me, but I have pressing business I must attend to. Mandrake will return you to your quarters at once.\" He laughed then, a harsh bark that sounded more like a sea lion than a man. George's skin crawled and he thought that maybe getting back to his cell might not be such a bad thing after all. As long as he didn't have to spend another minute in this frightening old man's company. And away from that smell... he thought. You know, the one like old dirty pennies. I know you know that scent. Roger had it on him when he came home from trying to ride his bike faster than usual to keep up with the older boys, his knees all scraped to heck and bloody. That smell is pretty much the same thing you're smelling now, don't try to deny it. And what are those brown stains on his teeth??  Vladimir seemed to have all but forgotten about him, and stood staring into the pool that had moments ago shown Roger. Now the liquid looked cloudy, and the image was incoherent. Unbeknownst to George, Mandrake had already appeared in the chamber, seemingly unbidden. He jumped when his hand clapped down on his shoulder to lead him back to the cell.  What he felt was nothing short of relief. # Roger's posterior was starting to grow numb from the train's ceaseless rattling as it surged along the tracks. He had the strangest sensation that they were breaking new\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 68 ground, as if some magical force were dropping fresh tracks just ahead of the lumbering behemoth to create a route that had never been traveled before. He had fallen asleep for a few hours it seemed, and his new feathered friend had apparently done the same. Percy lay a few feet away in a crumple of his own black wings and almost looked dead. When Roger blinked, sat up, and looked around however, the bird also began to stir, and the boy watched as he sort of pulled himself together and peered at him through bleary yellow eyes. \"Sleep well, fella?\" Percy asked. \"I guess so. My butt hurts though, and I haven't had anything to eat in a while.\" \"I know how you feel. Sleeping on trains takes a lot of getting used to,\" he remarked, yawning. I had no idea birds could yawn, Roger thought. \"Before we fell asleep last night, you were going to tell me something,\" Roger said. \"Something about a woman who you thought might be able to help me find my brother. What was her name again?\" \"Oh yes of course, Mother Florence is her name, she's the one we're going to see!\" Roger thought back to our conversation and realized the situation was indeed grave. Based on what he had heard at the giants' house, George could be in a lot of trouble, and so far he had only managed to stir the pot by escaping from people who would almost certainly make the connection between me and him.  \"I just didn't really understand how she could help us. Shouldn't I just go to the house and break him out of wherever Vladimir's got him locked up?\" Percy looked at Roger as though he had just sprouted a second head. \"Are you insane? Just waltz right in there, grab the keys, and spring George from Vladimir Cruor's personal dungeon, is that it?\" He paced about muttering to himself.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 69 \"Isn't that a fine idea, absolutely, why didn't I think of that to get my wings back! Sneak in the back door and reverse the spell. Genius!\" Percy's sarcastic tone stung a bit. \"Look, Percy, I'm sorry, but I really don't know what's going on here, and I have no clue who Vladimir Cruor is, anyway. So could you maybe fill me in on a few of the details?\" Roger spread his hands in an entreating gesture. \"Fair enough, I shouldn't have been so quick to judge. I remember when I was a foreigner here, too.\" He scratched at something in the dirt with one yellow claw. \"Sometimes I wish I could go home. Vladimir put me in this situation, that's true, but he also brought me here in the first place. But that was eons ago, not really worth mentioning now ...\" he trailed off. Roger could hear what sounded like a lifetime's worth of self-doubt in his voice, and it brought on a sudden wave of sympathy - both for the bird as well as himself, for the fact that he'd gotten stuck in a situation like this with no idea how to save George or get back home. Percy had managed to pique his curiosity, however. \"What do you mean, 'just walk in and undo the spell'?\" he asked. \"You're saying Vladimir took away your ability to fly... with magic?\" \"Damn straight he did.\" Roger rubbed my eyes. \"So what happened?\" \"I used to work for that old cur, if you can believe it. Not much of a story really, and I'd be lyin' if I said it didn't pain me some to tell it, but here goes ... \"Seems like a long time has passed, and I can't quite recall how many years ago this happened, but safe to say it was at least five harvests ago.\" He laughed like it was just some witty phrase he remembered.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 70 \"That fall - when Vladimir decided to strip me of my birthright, my gift - we were having a huge year in terms of the Harvest. Vladimir was feeling particularly benevolent, and when that happens you can be sure that most of the farmers around Zimarron are going home happy at the end of another successful day to get in bed with their wives, feeling all content and cozy and such. \"Anyway, this farmer by the name of Gertrude was so pleased at the success of his dairy cows all that year that he decided to make Vladimir a gift of two fine calves. The man came one day in a wagon and cart carrying the two gentle creatures, and although I wasn't there to see it, I'm sure Vladimir was touched. He has his moments of humanity after all. The farmer warned that the calves had to be tended to with the utmost care, since they were particularly vulnerable at that life stage, and so on, but he also said that they were two of the rarest calves ever to be born in the Realm. They bore identical golden birthmarks on their right flanks, and the farmer insisted that the signs indicated possibly sacred beings.\" \"Vladimir hired you to look after them, is that it?\" Roger asked. \"What made him give you the job? How did you even meet him in the first place?\" Once the questions started they were difficult to stop. \"Easy there, soldier, I'll answer everything in good time. The fact is, I was just flying by when Vladimir called out to me. Only, he didn't use his voice - not one that I could hear with my ears, anyway. He used his mind. Words bloomed in my head like any other personal thought that I might have, but I knew it was not my own. Remember how I said hello when you first boarded the train?\" Roger said that he did.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 71 \"Vlad's not the only one in the Realm who's got a knack for that type of conversation,\" he said with a smirk. \"Just about anyone can pick it up, although in my experience it's a pretty common trait amongst intelligent birds such as myself. It takes a little time and practice, but it's really no trick at all.\" \"You mean it takes practice to learn how to hear it, or to transmit it?\" Roger asked. \"Both, actually.\" \"But so how could you influence my thoughts when we hadn't even met yet?\" \"Some people are naturally gifted, and I've learned to read the signs in a human's aura. You had just tumbled into my boxcar all in a heap, and I knew from that alone you'd be bewildered and disoriented. Plus, you practically reeked of fear and vulnerability, so that gave me enough to go on. When I pick up on all those signals, it's easy enough to access where a person's mind would be most receptive to a message. All I wanted to do was placate your fears, and your mind took up the signal like a fish speeding off with a lure in its lip. \"Anyway, back to the story. Vladimir calls out to me since he sees me soaring by overhead, and I had done some work for him in the past, settling accounts with the farmers and such, so he must have recognized me or something. I get his message loud and clear - it's a job offer. I swoop down to the mansion just in time to see the old dairy farmer shuttling off with his wife in their rickety old wagon, and Vlad's standing there with the calves flanking him, one on each side just as calm as - well, just as calm as Hindu cows.\" Roger wondered how Percy knew what Hindus were - unless... did he say he hadn't always lived in Zimarron? Vladimir had 'brought him here,' but he sensed that\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 72 that was a story for another time. Remember, your job here is to get George and get home, not figure out the life story of an admittedly very remarkable bird. Percy fluffed his feathers and got back to the story. \"I come down and Vlad's standing there looking like a proud father with his two chubby sons - I think he had already picked names for them even, although I can't recall what they were - and he told me that they were to be locked in a pen he kept out back; my job would be simply to watch over them using my enhanced bird-vision, raising the alarm if any intruders or wildlife decided to make an unwelcome guest appearance. I agreed, signed on the dotted line, what have you. Speaking of which, Vladimir had in fact prepared a contract - conjured it out of thin air so far as I could tell, just sort of pulled it out from behind his back like some kind of devil - and had me scratch a little X at the bottom. And just like that my feathered ass became the property of Vladimir Cruor.\"   # Mandrake's grip on George's shoulder was firm as they walked back through the house along the same route they'd originally traveled. And when they came to the dungeon door, Mandrake glanced at him with a seemingly apologetic look. \"Sorry, little fella,\" he said. \"Master's orders. I'll see about getting you moved to a more suitable room. Soon.\" With that, he unlocked the door with a key from the huge ring on his belt, and led him downstairs. Once George was back in his cell, Mandrake closed the upstairs door firmly behind him, sliding the bolt into place with a resounding clank. Things looked grim, but not altogether hopeless. The sight of Roger in the pool, and the knowledge that he was here in this world, gave him an immense burst of hope.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 73 He could hear a strong wind howling under the eaves of Vladimir Cruor's mansion. Somewhere high up he could also make out the sound of rafters creaking, and he wondered if a major storm might not be brewing at that very moment.  Listening to the wind banking off the roof could hardly have been considered a decent way to pass the time, so he proceeded to pace around, trying not to cry. Well, maybe Roger is coming to get you. That might take a little while (although I have a feeling it won't), so what are you going to do in the meantime? You'll starve or die of boredom before long. He didn't really think that would happen, but he was definitely getting bored. He glanced desperately around the cell trying to find something to distract himself. There wasn't much to see: the cot, a toilet that was little more than a wooden box with a hole in the top, (he couldn't see any bolts or nails, but it certainly wouldn't budge when he gave it a hesitant shove with his foot), and a rubber ball, one that was a little smaller than a soccer ball, and covered in a creepy red and yellow pattern that bore a large white star on one side. He picked it up, squeezing it once to test the pressure, then bounced it on the ground. It rose back up to land in his hands. He walked over to the iron bars and held the ball up, pressing it against the gap - to his pleasure, it wouldn't fit through. Good - that meant he could kick the toy around for a while without losing it. The rubber texture and bounciness of the ball held something undeniably creepy, given the context, and he wondered who else might have played with it in this very same cell. Other kids? With that thought, he punted it against the far wall, perhaps a little harder than he intended owing to the pent-up fear and frustration at being held prisoner by a\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 74 weirdly sympathetic yet impotent servant and his frightening old master who smelled like the back of a haybarn. He punted the ball. Whang! It ricocheted off the cinder blocks and flew straight back at him like a cannonball. Its speed caught him by surprise and forced him to duck. It caromed off the bars - lucky he checked; if the ball had been a bit smaller it would have landed in the corridor to roll away, leaving him to hope for Mandrake to make another appearance and bring it back - and bounced back to land on the floor, the white star spinning crazily as it rolled, finally disappearing under the cot. It finally came to a rest underneath with a slight bap against the wall. George sighed. The ball had hardly provided him with the level of amusement he had been seeking. He closed my eyes, taking a deep breath and counting backwards from ten to stay calm, a trick his daddy had taught him. He got down on his hands and knees to go prospecting under the bed. The dungeon was dimly lit by two torches which flanked the staircase at the end of the corridor, but there was enough of a glow to see the space under the cot quite clearly. The ball lay off to one side, forgotten now. He gazed for what seemed like many minutes at the far wall. His lips trembled, and he felt his eyes sting with tears for what felt like the dozenth time that day. George could make out a terrifying milieu of words, numbers, and odd diagrams - all scratched in scraggly blocks of handwriting on the wall under the bed. Despite the panicked, desperate qualities most of them displayed, the messages were clearly the work of more than one person, and judging from the relative roughness and smoothness of certain images and phrases, some were fresh, and some might have been unspeakably old. There were lines too, the old four-vertical-and-one-horizontal slashes to make five.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 75 There were a lot of them. The anonymous authors of the messages had, over time, managed to cover almost the entire surface, to the point where hardly a square inch of unblemished wood remained. After reading a few of the notes, George wondered why they had felt the need to repeat what was basically the same message along the whole five-foot section. His eyes fixated on one whose letters were carved with neat, almost desperately deliberate fashion. It was as if the final hour had at last come at hand for the poor doomed soul who had written it. The message was essentially like all the others, but urgent, almost pleading in its brevity. It read: GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 76               CHAPTER 9  Dusk fell, and the stars began to come out, winking in the prairie sky like an old Lite-Brite. The pale riders had ridden hard through the day to reach the Cruor estate. They were tired and hungry, but the thought of showing such a side to Vladimir Cruor never even crossed their minds. He had summoned them - this they knew - and when a job came along, any displays of weakness fell under the category of \"utterly unthinkable.\" The Rangers knew their fearsome reputation, one which Vladimir had played no small part in helping to inspire, and they too are insistent on maintaining their frightening facade. Most prairie dwellers recalled the time the duo set fire to Farmer Hepsworth's barn after he'd failed to deliver his tribute crops on time; or there was that fearful night when the Rangers descended upon a peaceful town hall meeting in one of the Realm's more built-up business districts many miles to the north. That night, they had employed unseen aides to lock the doors from the outside and hijacked the meeting to deliver a fiery sermon. Martin had screamed bloody murder and intimidation at the parishioners while Luther stood off to one side with his arms crossed looking stoic. Martin told them\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 77 in his brutish tone that they had forgotten the benevolence of their Master, and to remember all that he had given them, lest their homes and livelihoods be laid to waste by one terrible storm that would swallow them up like Jonah and the whale. Much time had passed since those days, however. Now such tales were relegated to the late-night conversations of old sharecroppers and their wives in dim kitchens with the curtains drawn. The commoners knew well enough that one could never be too sure who - or what - might be listening, regardless of the distance between their homestead and Vlad's mansion. Rumor had it the king had spies in every corner of his domain. Some hinted at an elaborate network of torture chambers spread throughout the land. No one knew just how many men are on his payroll, volunteers and conscripts alike. Martin and Luther fell into this latter category, and they certainly relished their work. Fear and intimidation were their bread and butter, and Vladimir relied on them like he relied on his own two hands. They carried out their missions not just with ruthless efficiency, but with bloodthirsty enthusiasm. Oftentimes, while lying in bed waiting for sleep to overtake him (or some semblance of sleep; they say Vladimir only ever \"rests,\" and with one eye open at that, like a dragon), he'll think of some old errand that he has sent the Rangers on, reminiscing with pleasure at how they must have swooped in, possibly trampling a child or an old woman under the hooves of their wild horses - both stark white in color - as they roared into town to deliver the latest message of forced obedience and complacency. Although, to say \"complacency\" implies that perhaps the good folk who call the Realm home - and there are many, the Realm exists in a borderless state where the ends are as yet undiscovered - are unaware of some terrible danger looming over their heads. They know this danger well, and most\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 78 have become acquainted with Vladimir's wrathful temperament, and tendency to rain fire and destruction on whomever he likes when displeased. The riders approached the door to the fortress on foot. They led their white horses along by matching black leather bridles.  \"Come in, it's all right, those buffoons left a while ago,\" Vladimir says, greeting his Rangers as they step through the door with perceptible caution. They may be long-time employees of the Master of the Realm, but that does not mean they feel at ease around him; they've learned not to underestimate his temper. \"What is it you would have us do?\" Luther asked. \"Very simple. There's a boy out there, riding that confounded train - you know, the one the conductor insists on driving around, picking up stragglers who happen to need a lift - and I want him. He's worth a lot to me - alive, mind you - and I want you to adopt a very careful approach to this mission.\" The Rangers nodded their heads in understanding. \"You think they're off to see Mother Florence?\" Martin said. \"I can't say for sure - the boy seems to be dampening my attempts to read his thoughts somehow - but I do know he's with that dratted crow Percy. I should have taken care of that pest a long time ago... at any rate, Percy is probably advising the boy on how best to retrieve his brother from my clutches.\" \"Deliver the boy. Sounds simple enough,\" Luther remarked with confidence. \"Of course, I know you men are quite keen on adventure, and I wouldn't want to prohibit you from any extracurricular objectives along the way, so to speak. Maybe create a bit of havoc at that old wench's campsite, for instance.\" The Rangers exchanged sly matching grins.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 79 \"That shouldn't present much of a problem.\" Martin muttered. \"Mother Florence is difficult to find. They say you can't get to that site unless she wants you to find her. But with your tracking skills, perhaps you can fulfill this extra order. You will be rewarded handsomely.\" \"No trouble at all, boss. We'll find the site, give the old woman something to think about for your trouble - then grab the boy when he shows up.\" \"Sounds fine to me, fellas. Now make haste! It's already been several hours since he managed to escape those blundering Grimsrud brothers. Speaking of which, I want that meddlesome crow punished for taking part in this fiasco - destroy him as well.\" \"Certainly, Master.\" Martin and Luther knew the Grimsrud brothers well - those giant good-for-nothings had been causing problems for the master for as long as either of them could remember. The Rangers took no greater pleasure than in fulfilling a task that has already been bungled by inferior workers. Such opportunities allowed them to further cement their reputations as ruthless henchmen. Without another word, they made for the exit. Their eyes glowed like hot coals.  # How long can this train ride possibly go on? Roger thought as he watched Percy groom his feathers for what seemed like the thousandth time that morning. Spend too much time on this train and George'll be dead before you even figure out where they're keeping him, let alone see him in the flesh. He doubted that his efforts would fall quite so short, but nonetheless he had begun to grow very anxious. Nevertheless, he wanted to hear Percy's story.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 80 \"Well, so? You signed a contract that Vladimir conjured out of thin air. Then what?\" Some definite impatience had begun to work its way into Roger's voice. \"I agreed to watch the calves,\" Percy said, with a flourish of his wing. \"The responsibility was all mine, and I understood that. The very first evening was particularly fine, as I remember - there I was, perched up high on a weather vane that overlooked the pen Vladimir had built. They milled about in that useless manner cows have and I started to get bored pretty quickly. The moon was out, not a breath of breeze - perfect conditions for a little midnight soar, so I looked around, made sure no one else was watching, and took off. \"In the beginning I meant it to be just a quick out-and-back - to the little patch of forest beyond the foothills, at most - but I suppose the night air got the best of me, and I was out for longer than expected. Quite a bit longer.\" He shuddered as he prepared to tell what Roger presumed to be the grisly outcome of the story. \"You may not know this, but the wildlife around the Realm can be... kinda fierce. That season the coyotes were acting particularly ravenous and I... well, I should have been there to raise the alarm, but when I got back it was too late.\" He grimaced in a way that Roger guessed only birds could, somehow twisting his beak with regret. \"There was blood everywhere. I couldn't save them, I...\" He held a wing over his face for a second to regain his composure. \"It was a goddamn mess. Vladimir heard their bellowing and appeared just as I arrived on the scene. He...\" Percy paused, as if trying to summon the strength to recount what happened next. \"He pointed his gnarled old finger at me and shot out a bolt of blue lightning that damn near caused me to go blind. That passed - I still see pretty good, for a bird - but it did plenty of damage in other ways.\" He lifted his right wing - Roger had already noticed how he favored the left, and raising the right\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 81 appeared to require considerable effort - and revealed a gruesome scar that bulged purple and showed in a bald patch where there once had been healthy feathers. \"What on earth did he do to you?\" Roger asked, awestruck. \"Clipped my wings, simple as that. Only had to wreck this one here though, had enough mercy I suppose to leave me with one good wing. Doesn't matter though, the damage was enough. I lost consciousness, must have dropped like a sack full of flour. Woke up on the edge of an abandoned salt mine some distance to the south. Took me damn near a week to get back to any recognizable part of the Realm, and either way I've been stuck looking for Mother Florence ever since.\" He shuffled his feet, as though ashamed for still not having achieved his goals. \"She'll help us out though, my boy, she'll know what to do.\" A bit of confidence returned to his squawky voice. \"Say, you hungry?\" Roger was famished. All his thoughts had been devoted toward advancing a solution that would free George and get him home safely, and he had forgotten all about his stomach, which he now realized was rumbling about as hard as the train. \"Say no more. I've got a few other tricks besides just knowing how to read your mind.\" He tottered over to the corner of the boxcar and returned with a checkered handkerchief. \"It takes a special kind of bird to survive in the Realm under Vladimir Cruor's rule.\" He waved the handkerchief over the floor with his beak and dropped it, and Roger watched the cloth puff up as it fell. Instead of hitting the ground and lying flat, however, it stayed upright as a tent shielding some object, a large lump invisible before but now made apparent from having the cloth draped over it. The lump was shaped like a loaf of bread. \"Did you just...?\" he started, but Percy had already whisked away the handkerchief to reveal a steaming, golden-crusted hunk of fresh bread that smelled like\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 82 a warm slice of heaven. Through some trick with the napkin he had seemingly conjured breakfast out of thin air. Roger's mouth began to water immediately. \"Well, don't be shy, let's eat!\" he said, tearing off a generous hunk with his beak and lobbing it in Roger's direction. # George sat with his back to the opposite cell wall, clutching his head and trying to keep his thoughts from reeling out of control. The notes under the bed had given him a bad shock, to be sure, but if he was to have any hope of escaping he needed to keep his wits about him. Roger couldn't run the entire operation on his own, and he'd be damned if he was going to just sit in his cell without doing anything to try and help them get home. But what? he thought. You can't get out of here by yourself; the only thing would be to fake sick for Mandrake. Get him to open the door to check, then run for the door. He had pulled off a fake fever to get out of school with his daddy a couple times, but the stakes were considerably lower in those cases. He rubbed his fingers against his temples in a symmetrical motion as he had seen his father do on a number of occasions when he was having one of his \"work headaches,\" and he did start to feel a little better, but then the pain pulsed jaggedly behind his left eyebrow and the gray cot wavered at the edge of his vision. He was too frightened by what he had seen written underneath to look at it for too long. He got to his feet and paced around a bit, wondering if Mandrake might make another appearance that evening. George guessed that it was probably only late afternoon, and he'd have a while to wait, if Mandrake even planned to bring him any dinner. That painful, empty gnawing had begun to increase in his belly, and he realized he'd probably need to get used to it. At least for the time being.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 83 The ball lay forgotten beside the cot, where it had come to rest against one leg after bouncing into that dark place to reveal the writing on the wall. Who were these children who came here before me? George wondered. They almost certainly were children, after all. The note that had jumped out at him was painstakingly formed, but the others were scrawled in a way that only a child's hand could have produced. A few displayed the backwards R's and S's that George associated with his own travails in learning to print by hand. [Relax, child. Vladimir has a reason for everything he does, and you'd do well to remember that.] That invasive line of thinking again, as though someone were projecting their own thoughts into his head. This impression was impossible to ignore, as the voice seemed to rise out of nowhere. [You could be a very lucky boy, George, if Vladimir decides you'd make a worthy heir. Think of this as a trial period. It's for you to sit tight while he makes other preparations. Preparations to transform you into a true member of the Realm. He likes you, George, and soon you'll be living the kind of life that you could scarcely have imagined.] He didn't like the sound of that one bit, he clutched his head. It felt like someone - or something - had forced its way into his mind like an uninvited houseguest. There was definitely an outside source projecting this voice, though it spoke in an unidentifiable whisper. [I have many names. Mandrake perhaps is one of my personalities, but I'll tell you I live in this house - through this house. I can be everywhere at once, if it pleases\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 84 the Master. I sense a great strength in you, and don't doubt that you'll find yourself up to the task that Vladimir wants you for.]      [I don't want to do any tasks! I want my big brother, and I want to go home.] I was beginning to sound childish, but I didn't care.      [Your brother may very well join you in time. I hear Vladimir wanted him in the first place, but you stumbled through and now both of you could be eligible for a big promotion.]      I was starting to have trouble following this line of thinking, one of the major factors being that I was scared witless, had been ever since I saw the messages.      [Leave me alone!] I shouted, concentrating my mind to make it as loud a thought as possible. To my relief, it seemed as though the foreign voice in my head shrank back a bit at that, as if it hadn't expected something so forceful . All he really wanted was for it to leave him alone.   Played out in my mind's eye, it didn't seem as foolproof as I had been counting on. Maybe quite the opposite of foolproof, whatever that might be. Wherever he was, I fervently hoped that Roger was having better luck at finding a way out of this mess that I had gotten us into. I closed my eyes and let my thoughts wander - the other voice had apparently obeyed my request and gone somewhere to let me cool off for the time being - and soon I felt  drowsiness creeping over my eyelids .  I let it take over, my back inching down the wall, head sliding to rest on my left shoulder. When people sleep they don't have a care in the world, I thought. Maybe if I die, going to heaven will just be like having a really nice dream, only you never have to wake up. I could be okay with that.  I was gone.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 85  # Roger dusted the last few crumbs off the front of his shirt and sat back with his eyes closed, a smile of pure satisfaction splayed across his face. He belched. \"That was good!\" Roger exclaimed to Percy, who was still pecking at his meal across from him. \"Glad you enjoyed it,\" he mumbled between bites. \"How long until we get there, do you think?\" Percy took a break from the loaf to consider this. \"Well, the thing about that is - we can't exactly just leap out the side of the train and expect to find her. In fact, if we did that, I can pretty much guarantee we'd end up as wolf-food within the hour. That, or cursed to wander the plains until we starved or went insane. No, we need a more precise means of getting to her camp, and that will require some diligence on our part.\" He paused, and his voice took on a grave tone. \"There are three challenges on this train, Roger, which we must overcome if we are to have any hope of proceeding further in this adventure of ours.\" \"Challenges?\" he gulped. \"Yes, in a way. I wanted us to have something in our bellies before we got started. They are not for the faint of heart.\" \"What are you talking about? What do we have to do?\" This just gets worse and worse, he thought. Losing George in the first place was bad enough, but now you're mixed up with a talking crow who needs you to take on some challenges? What are the odds that he's been pulling your leg this entire time, or using you? You might have made a very stupid decision by leaving those brothers and hopping this train, but you just had\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 86 to make a run for it. They were planning to bring you straight to George after all, a free ride, and you left. But he knew the brothers were not going to help him. He had no choice but to escape. [Roger, can you please pay attention so I can tell you about the tasks now?] He broke from his thoughts and looked at Percy. He had forgotten that he could get a pretty good read on my mind when he wanted to, and he turned red as he realized Percy had likely overheard the paranoid speculation that the crow planned to use him. \"I'm not pulling your leg, son, the Realm is a dangerous place and this is serious business.  \"Now, do I have your full attention?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 87               CHAPTER 10  Confusion and despair swept over George like a black shroud. The iron bars gleamed in the torchlight, and his mind did its best to bat away the fierce terror that continued to encompass all the rest of his emotions. He palmed sweat off his forehead and tried to steady his rapid breathing. It wasn't just being in a dungeon that scared him. He could hear something down there. Something that made a slight shuffling sound as it dragged its horrid body along the corridor. You're either imagining things or still dreaming. You may be in trouble but at least you're alone in here. But was he, really? George stepped over to the bars and wrapped his arms around them. His heart felt as though it had been dipped into ice water. It thudded dully somewhere in my throat, and I swallowed hard, as if trying to push it back down to the place where a heart belongs. An image rose in his mind of a long, scaly beast, which looked like a fat boa\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 88 constrictor crossed with a hog. In his imagination it grunted and dragged itself closer to where he stood, trapped and helpless. George strained his ears, at the same time praying not to hear anything else.  He glanced toward the end of the hall where the twin torches lit the stairs leading up and out of his prison. Shadows danced across the walls like a grotesque puppet show, and to his over-exhausted mind they looked nothing less than monstrous. In one corner a clown with glistening fangs emerged, its claw-like hands reaching out in the flickering light to take him by the throat and sink its teeth into his neck to guzzle his blood. This began to morph almost as soon as he could tell what it was, now changing to a mummy with rotting bandages drooping off its decomposing face. The head creaked backwards on its unspeakably old and disfigured shoulders, and the mouth yawned open to reveal putrid teeth, which only grew more elongated the more the head tipped back. Shuff...shuff...shuff... That sound again. George's nerves seemed to be on fire with adrenaline, and a terrible thought occurred to him: what if this isn't a dungeon at all, but a kind of zoo? A place where Vladimir Cruor keeps his favorite pet creatures - human or otherwise - on display for some bizarre purpose? Maybe he's planning to invite all his friends over, just so they can stand around and stare at me? And to what end? Feed me to some terrible lizard he keeps in some other freaky pen for the grand finale? The idea had a horrible plausibility to it. I He stepped back from the bars and staggered backwards to the cot, my heart seemingly having crawled even farther up my windpipe. The sound was still out there; he knew it was real now, that sound moving slowly up the hallway to come and slink between the bars of my cell and devour me alive. The face of a wolf now loomed up at him from the wall. Loose slobber ran in rivulets down each sharpened fang. He could hear its wet, monstrous tongue slapping\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 89 against moist lips that would savor each morsel as the beast licked the gristle from his bones. I've never felt more powerless in my entire life, before or since. He sat down on the cot and began to weep. The thing in the corridor continued to inch closer towards him, still hidden by the dark shadows along the floor that dripped down from where they danced and morphed into those horrifying shapes before my eyes on the wall. The dim glow from the twin torches only created a small sphere of light that illuminated little more than the immediate area surrounding the bottom of the stairs, and whatever lay out there could make its approach unseen, so long as it stayed low to the ground. Closer and closer it crept, and George shrank back against the cell wall as much as humanly possible. That was when the voice entered his head again. [Don't be afraid, George. I'm just a friend of Vlad's. He keeps me around the castle to keep an eye on things. I won't bite, I just want to have a look at you...] The loathsome thing at last drew into focus as it finally reached the cell. A candle that Mandrake had lit before leaving threw a warm shade of light that at any other time would be extremely comforting. Here, in this place, and given the thing it illuminated, the effect was nothing short of hideous. The creature that now stood before him was very long. Its tail looped back far enough behind its body to curl over on itself multiple times in a grotesque parody of a pig's tail. Black bristles poked out from the pink flesh of its tail. A hairless body was attached to it, speckled and muddy, like a pig that had spent the day rolling around in the mud. A few twisted feathers poked out of a hide made of scales larger than any George had ever seen. Like dragon scales, he thought\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 90 His eyes traveled along its full length to arrive at last at its head, which bobbed near the bars, peering in, while emitting a low hissing sound. Its head was the worst part. A black, forked tongue darted out - long in an exaggerated way, like the tail - and flicked between the bars towards him as if sampling the air. He remembered reading somewhere that snakes kept their sense of smell in the tongue. The air reeked of its breath, an eye-watering odor like rotten onions and wet garbage, and he found himself forced to suppress his gag reflex. Its eyes were black and lifeless, plugged into its smooth face like buttons above a pointed snout that was just thick enough to prevent the creature from sticking its whole head through the bars.  [Just wanted to have a look at you, my boy. You're going to be very famous soon. The entire Realm shall know your name, and hear stories of your greatness proclaimed by Vladimir himself.] [What stories of greatness? What are you going to do to me?] [You'll see, son. It won't be long now. Your time is fast approaching.] Where was that voice coming from? I He felt his consciousness slipping away like grains of sand through his fingers - the adrenaline had taxed his system in a way that he hadn't known possible. He gave his head a brisk shake and forced himself to hold on. Don't be such a coward, he can't get in here. If he could, it'd be a whole different story, but you're safe in here... for now. [Child, be calm, I don't mean to upset you. I won't come any closer, if my appearance really frightens you that badly.] As if you have a choice, I thought. If you were skinny enough to get inside I think I'd be screaming my lungs out as I watched you devour me alive. Like in that National Geographic show where the boa constrictor\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 91 unhinges its jaws to eat a whole pig. Except I don't think you'd swallow me whole, would you? You'd tear me limb from limb with those disgusting shark teeth. Then, the thing with which I would have thought it'd be impossible to communicate or reason grinned at me. Its lips curled back in a gruesome parody of a human smile, exposing jagged teeth that gleamed in the light from my candle. He could hear my thoughts. Without realizing it, I'd been having a full conversation with this monster in my head. As the enormity of that fact started to sink in, the loathsome beast continued to stare at me, its head bobbing rhythmically up and down, the tongue darting out to taste the air. Its midsection seemed to throb - in multiple places - with some alien heartbeat. I shuddered as I tried to imagine what the beast's insides might look like.Please, leave me alone. Please go away, I pleaded wordlessly. The hiss seemed to turn raspier, like a change in tone from pleasant to cold and aloof. [All right. I can see you're not in the mood to chat. But I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be paying you another visit quite soon, my boy.] With that, it drew back, turned, and slunk down along the corridor, heading back to whatever vile pit or nest it might call home. A friend of Vladimir's, all right. He probably sleeps with that thing like its his doggy, George thought.  He waited for some rebuttal from the beast, but none came. It only pulsed forward with that shuff... shuff... shuff like an overfed python carving a trail through the leaves and detritus of a steaming jungle floor.  #\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 92 Roger looked at Percy with growing impatience and waited for him to describe the tasks that lay ahead, tasks that he now viewed as just a few more obstacles standing between me and my brother. \"Well? I'm listening.\" \"Good. Now that I have your undivided attention I can tell you everything I know about what lies ahead... which is very, very little.\" He paused. Roger gaped at him. \"You don't know?\" \"I know what I've heard, which is this: there are three boxcars between us and the conductor. In order to reach Mother Florence's campsite, we must successfully complete the challenges, one after the other, all or none, contained in each boxcar. The successful completion of each challenge will provide us with a golden key without which we cannot hope to pass through the following door. If we manage to make it through all three in one piece, we'll be considered worthy to speak with the man up front and request an unscheduled stop. Without the assistance of the conductor, who is said to know the Realm like the back of his hand, one can never hope to get where they are going, and we would end up riding the rails until the end of time, which would almost certainly result in us losing our minds and starving to death. \"Those boxcars form a kind of magical barrier between him and us. It prevents him from having to deal with more unruly customers who might distract him from his duties, and of course it also determines who is worthy of his help and guidance. Naturally, we already know we're worthy, but we'll never convince him without the proof of having made it through the three cars. I think we've got a good shot - by myself, I never thought I'd muster the courage to attempt it, but now that we're together, I'd say we have a distinct advantage, wouldn't you?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 93 \"You make it sound like it's pretty dangerous in there,\" Roger said. \"Oh yes, extremely dangerous. Would never even dream of going in there without an able-bodied accomplice. I think you've got the right stuff though, kid. Both of us brought to the Realm against our will, winding up on the same train - has the ring of destiny to it, don't you think?\" Roger didn't think. He only nodded with that puzzled expression never quite leaving his face. This is getting to be a bit much to handle, my friend, he thought. [Not at all,] came Percy's voice right back in his head. [Just take deep breaths and remember some advice that I picked up along my travels: don't panic!] That sounded pretty reasonable to Roger. He consciously slowed his breathing and steeled his nerves, which had already begun to feel taxed and useless. \"So, how do we get started then?\" \"That's the spirit! I thought you'd never ask. The game begins just beyond the door of this very carriage.\" He glanced over and saw the door Percy spoke of, which up to that point he had somehow failed to notice. In fact, Roger could have sworn that it hadn't been there when he collapsed in a heap on the floor just before meeting Percy. It was big, taking up almost the entire far wall, and built from  panels; it door reminded him of the oversized entrance to the house where the giant brothers lived, but it appeared strangely out of place given the rusty supports and cheap clapboard siding that surrounded it. \"If you'd be so kind, please go over and give the door three good knocks. The first one does not require a key - well, other than the willingness to proceed, which is asking a lot, given the unspeakable danger that almost certainly lies just beyond this threshold...\" Percy chuckled.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 94 Roger glared at him. \"Do you want me to help you or not?\" \"Yes, of course, I'm sorry, we'll be quite fine, I'm sure. Now, if you don't mind, I've been waiting quite a while to have my chance to visit Mother Florence, and without you I'm afraid we don't stand a chance. Believe me, you have my deepest gratitude for arriving when you did. I don't think I could have waited around much longer, but I could never have attempted this alone, as I've already said.\" Roger sighed. \"Fine. Let's get this over with.\" He strode over to the door, hoping he looked more confident than he felt, and pounded the door three times, bizarrely hoping that it wouldn't be considered a rude or forceful knock, given the fact that I had no idea what might be waiting to greet me on the other side. The first boxcar turned out to contain something extremely foul-tempered indeed.  # \"Hector, quit kicking up dust and come give me and your sister a hand with the dishes!\" Mother Florence's son glanced back with resentment in his gaze. \"But mom, I only just started playing,\" he groaned. \"I don't care, I fixed you a nice meal, and you're going to help clean up, just like we do every night. Come on, quick like a bunny!\" Hector trotted over to where Mother Florence and her daughter Maisie were scrubbing dishes in a large soapy basin. She could sense something in the air, and when that happened, it usually meant visitors were on their way. Their sleeping tent stood off to one side of the clearing where they had made their camp this month. Rarely did they\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 95 stay in one place for long; the Realm could be a cruel place at times when you belonged on Vladimir Cruor's \"naughty\" list. Maisie polished a tin plate. A warm feeling of pride bloomed in Florence's chest at her little girl's diligence. \"Thank you, Maisie, there's a good girl.\" Hector meanwhile grabbed a handful of wooden spoons and began wiping them with a rag. Dust swirled about their campsite and rippled the canvas fabric of the careworn tent. An enchanted barrier glimmered in a wide circle around the clearing, a necessary precaution when trying to raise two young children in the barren wilderness that Vladimir had banished them to. They used to have a home, but that was a long time ago. Before Florence angered him by spurning his advances, finally walking out the door after his final attempt, leaving him to rage in that awful fortress he called home. She wondered if he was in there now, and if he still thought about her.  If her instincts were correct about the people headed for her camp - and the nature of their visit - Vladimir might have cause for great concern indeed. The aura that she picked up from them - there were two, that much was certain - spelled nothing less than a grave threat to Vladimir Cruor's seat of power, for she detected something powerful in them as well, a desire so strong it could tear a hole in the fabric of this world. Someone needing rescue? Waiting long and painful years to reclaim a valuable gift that was stolen? The wishes and motives that I'm sensing blend together like the fingerpaints that I conjured out of thin air for Maisie and Hector on their last birthday. Well, she thought, if they want to find me, they must have a pretty good idea of the dedication it will take to find this camp. She could tell they were traveling by train - anyone who really wants to come and see me must ride the rails - and if they expect that crotchety old conductor to make a\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 96 special stop, they'll have to survive those three boxcars of yore. I even helped design those challenges, knowing how easily Vladimir might decide to dispatch someone or something - those dreadful Rangers, most likely - to teach me a little lesson in humility before one's superiors. I can tell that the visitors are good people, though.If they survive the journey and actually make it here, I'll be more than happy to help. The dishes were finished and placed in their small crate to dry. The children looked exhausted. Maisie tugged on her mother's dress and asked if she might tell her and Hector a bedtime story. \"I know just the one,\" she said with a smile. \"Would you like to hear about the evil prince who courted the damsel, only to find that cruelty and fear were no way to win a woman's heart?\" They looked a little perplexed, but nodded nonetheless. Evil princes usually had a way of piquing the curiosity of young children. Courtship and love they knew less about, but fairy tales about failed romances did not get enough credit, in Florence's opinion. She led them into the tent and closed the flap. They both needed a little help getting into their nighties - blue for Hector and scarlet for Maisie. Florence had already folded back the corner of their shared bedroll, which I've filled with enchanted feathers to insulate them against the Realm's harsh nighttime temperatures. With her two cubs wrapped cozily in their bedding, looking up at me with shining eyes, Mother Florence began her tale: \"Once upon a time, there was a kind farmer who lived alone in a big house out on the prairie. He cared deeply about his work, and made sure that the harvest each year was even more bountiful than the one that preceded it. But those crops alone could not\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 97 fill up his heart - something was lacking, and he began to grow bitter when he found himself unable to determine what it was. \"He continued to work hard, but his heart had already begun to grow black and corrupted from loneliness. He had invented a technique that allowed his farm to produce far more than anyone else's, and before long the villagers wanted to know what his secret was, for it seemed that as the farmer's crops thrived, their own fortunes suffered, almost to the point where they were unable to put food on the table each night for their families. This continued for several years, and the Realm teetered on the brink of outright famine. No one but the kind farmer prospered, only he had lost his kindness somewhere along the way, it seemed. No more did he offer gifts to his friends when they celebrated a birth or a marriage; no more did he host lavish gatherings where whisky flowed like water and warm, fresh bread lined the tables. He kept it all to himself, and the villagers began to think that he had brought a curse on them, using some enchantment to sap their livelihoods and provide only for himself. \"As things progressed in this manner, the farmer, whom we can call Ivan,  became extremely wealthy. He hired new people to work for him, as the borders of his property constantly seemed to be expanding, even swallowing up the bankrupt estates of men who had once considered him a dear friend.  But still, he was not happy. The hole in his heart had only seemed to widen, filling up with poison and bile as it did so, and all the land and wealth in the Realm could not seem to change it. \"You see, Ivan wanted a wife more than anything, someone to assuage the deep isolation he felt, in spite of the fact that he was constantly surrounded by servants who tended to his every need.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 98 \"Magic has long been present in the Realm, as you two know, and I myself became proficient in its use many years ago, but it has a tendency to hide itself. Everybody knows it exists, but there are not many people who know how to wield it effectively. The disenfranchised landowners who used to rely on Ivan for help suspected that he had begun training in the dark arts, and that perhaps he had begun to use a form of black magic to sap their power and influence and essentially make life miserable for everyone. All they could do was sit up late with their wives in candlelit kitchens, hoping against hope that things would improve soon, and what recourse they might have when things inevitably grew worse, instead. Which, of course, they did. One autumn in the midst of the famine, Ivan managed to pull in a record-breaking harvest, which he sold for a tidy profit to rich businessmen from the east.\" Florence gazed into the faces of her two babies and wondered whether to go on with this particular tale. She had never told them what happened next. She took a deep breath and decided to continue. \"That same year, people's children started disappearing.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 99               CHAPTER 11  No sooner had Roger thumped his fist against the door for the third time than it began to swing open in a wide berth that seemed to go on forever. What it revealed was breathtaking.  A massive, sloping hill covered in lush green grass spread out before him as far as his eyes could see. Percy moved over to stand next to the boy and gazed out as well, equally dumbstruck. \"Well, I'll be...\" Percy murmured. With that, they stepped through the door, and onto the grass, which felt springy and good beneath their feet. The rattle of the train was gone, which came as a huge relief to Roger's sore body. A slight breeze stirred his hair and ruffled Percy's feathers. The air smelled like freshly harvested pollen. Pink flowers, strange and tall, dotted the field that lay before them, and Percy and Roger cautiously began to move forward. \"Percy... what is this place?\" he asked. \"I couldn't tell you, seems like a beautiful day in here though, don't you think?\" Percy replied cheerfully.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 100 \"I don't know, I'm getting the creeps.\" \"Don't worry, look, I can already see the next door at the bottom of the hill.\" Percy pointed his good wing down the slope and, sure enough, an oak door identical to the one they had just passed through appeared to rise up directly out of the ground. Roger couldn't see anything that it might lead to - as far as he could tell, it was simply standing out in the open field - but the atmosphere around it did seem to possess a kind of shimmering quality, like the air above the hood of the family Subaru after a long drive on a hot summer day. \"Yeah, I see it. Let's just get there quickly, okay?\" \"Anything you say, boss.\" They continued their trek through the grass, which was ankle-high and waved in the breeze like angel's hair. The fresh air tasted marvelous, and Roger bent to smell one of the strange pink flowers that seemed to sprout everywhere around the two travelers, and were most likely the source of the overriding scent. Somewhere a bee hummed its merry tune, and save for that mild breath of air, all was still. \"Hey Percy, come check out this flower, it's really weird!\" Roger called over to his feathered companion. The flower he had paused to inspect resembled a very large tulip, with a pink bell that drooped slightly towards the ground under its own weight. Out of this cup extended a thick white pistil; as he watched, fascinated, the pistil began to twitch and point about, as if probing the atmosphere for sensory information about a possible nearby intruder. \"Not now Roger, we're wasting precious time. Come along, if you please.\" \"Oh and by the way, what's the challenge here? Walk across a field on a beautiful day? Pretty daunting!\" he laughed. \"Back where I come from, 'a walk in the park' usually\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 101 isn't considered too difficult.\"  Percy rolled his eyes and continued on ahead. I bent to examine the flower closer, its pistil still switching back and forth like the tail of an anxious puppy. Roger was so close now that his nose almost grazed the protruding segment as he took a good sniff. Catherine... it smells like our old tabby Catherine after she's been digging around in the root cellar, I thought, like a boy in a dream. Then, abruptly, it stopped moving. At that moment, the earth began to tremble, and Roger felt the grass that had previously seemed so spongy beneath his feet start to separate, giving rise to a bubble of earth that increased in volume so quickly that he lost his footing and fell flat on his back. Somewhere at the edge of his senses Percy screamed. The crow's voice was drowned out by the earthquake that accompanied the rising mound, and before Roger had any idea what was happening, the dirt clods fell away to reveal what could only be described as a beast out of his worst nightmare. Ragged teeth gnashed at the air as a gigantic mole-like creature tossed bits of sod off its body, reminding Roger of the individual squares that he had once seen laid down for an artificial soccer field. Its black fur had a healthy lustre to it - for one demented second he even thought that he could make out his own reflection in its hide. Then, it opened its mouth, tilted its head back to the artificial sky that loomed above, and let out a roar that was the most tremendous sound that Roger had ever heard in his young life. It thrashed its paws in a horrible spasmodic motion. The eyes were dead and black, and for an instant I had a flash of deja vu, as if those eyes had appeared to me in a dream on some recent night, belonging to some snake-like creature that hissed and dragged itself along on its belly. Attached to its forehead was the long green stalk and pink cup of the flower that Roger had previously admired as picturesque and\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 102 enchanting. It reminded him of a certain fish that lived in the depths of the ocean where no light could penetrate, luring its prey with the help of a long protrusion that glowed at the tip like a demon reading lamp.  He scrambled to his feet, located Percy, and scooped the bird up into his arms like the ragged bundle that he was, and He began to run. The monster immediately lurched in their direction and began to lumber along at a positively frightening pace behind them. All of this happened in the course of five seconds or less, and his mind went blank. Roger ran as fast as his legs could carry him, and, for the second time in several hours, it felt as though his lungs might burst from the effort. Then, like a flash of lightning from a clear blue sky, he remembered the Barlow knife that his father had given him the night before all this madness started. Still running, he fumbled awkwardly around in his pockets as he begged his own body to keep up the pace, and maintained his grip on Percy, who was squawking in terror as he looked over his shoulder to keep an eye on the distance between them and their pursuer. It was was closing on them with terrifying speed. \"Roger this thing is getting closer and it looks hungry run!\" Percy screamed. The boy's mind was like an artist's canvas smeared with the black paint of terror. The fingers of his right hand at last grasped the handle of the knife, which bounced wildly around in his pocket. I struggled to grip it, and finally was able to take hold, In the same instant, he withdrew the weapon and flipped it open with his thumbnail in one fluid motion. Using his thumbnail, I managed to flip the knife open, still running full-speed down the hill. His legs felt like they were pedaling a bicycle that was going far too fast to be considered safe, and his mind flashed back to that summer morning when his attempt to jump the stone wall at the bottom of our hill back home had ended in\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 103 disaster. He also had a crazy thought of his dad teaching him never to run with sharp objects. Leo had never seemed so far away as he did in that moment, and Roger realized he had hardly had two thoughts about him or his home back in Maine since this wild journey began. \"Percy, hold on!\" he cried in desperation, and in midstride he spun around and lashed out with the open pocketknife. At that moment, the small knife was transformed into a magnificent broadsword worthy of a king, while I was a knight clad in silver armor ready to do battle. Two things happened in blistering succession. First, the monstrous beast that Roger had apparently unearthed by stopping to look at the flower drew close enough to lunge forward for the kill, its horrible teeth slicing the air and showering the pair with foaming saliva, blind eyes rolling madly in its head. Then, the tip of his blade connected with the stem of the flower attached to its forehead with a meaty shik sound, and a gout of maroon blood spurted from the fresh wound. The flower, having been severed neatly near its base, tumbled to the ground in a flutter of pink petals from the tulip-like bell, which had practically exploded in the same second. The creature let out a low howl that resembled what Roger imagined a cow in terrible pain must sound like. The noise was deafening, and caused the earth to shake, and in his confusion he dropped Percy - as well as the knife - and tumbled headlong to the ground as he tried to clap his hands over his ears and block out the vibrations of the behemoth's agonized moan. He begged whatever starry apparition might be watching over the Realm to spare his life, and allow him to continue on this quest to save his little brother. Percy lay beside him in a tangle of feathers and did not appear to be moving; he added a quick side-prayer to ask that his companion's life be spared as well. Percy lay in\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 104 the grass covering his head, waiting for the giant mole's teeth to sink into his neck and dispatch him from the world forever. But the fatal bite never came. Slowly, Roger lowered his hands, which had created a sweaty kind of suction effect from having been pressed so tightly against his ears. To his surprise, they were greeted by silence when his hearing came back to normal (aside from the slight ringing that remained from the creature's insane braying). \"Percy? Are you all right?\" Fear stole into his gut like indigestion, and his heart made an attempt to clamber straight into his throat. To Roger's joy, Percy began to stir. Waves of relief coursed over him like an ocean, and his heartbeat returned to some semblance of a proper rhythm. \"I think so... Roger, what in the blue tarnation was that?\" the bird managed to murmur. He tapped his body in various places with the tip of his good wing, like a person checking to make sure nothing was broken. Roger sat up and turned around to try and answer his question. What he saw was a tiny black mole scurrying off in the opposite direction they had been running in, appearing to make a hasty retreat towards whatever it considered to be shelter - someplace underground, he assumed. The flower that had previously extended from the glistening black fur of its forehead lay shriveled on the grass, the beautiful pink bell reduced to nothing more than a bed of petals strewn upon the surrounding earth. Before his eyes, the thick green stalk continued to shrink and diminish, as though some invisible force had sucked all the water out of the plant's cells. In a matter of seconds, the lack of its former host had reduced the flower to a wrinkled green straw that was almost indiscernible from the grass in which it now lay, and he watched in fascination as\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 105 the tiny black creature disappeared from view. It appeared to have burrowed straight back into the earth to hide from us. \"Was that the challenge, Percy?\" he asked breathlessly. \"Ah, yes, I would say so. Looks like we passed thanks to you. Good lad.\" He got up and brushed himself off, looking very indignant at having been jostled around so violently. \"Now, before anything else comes out of the earth to try and tear our heads off, can we please get a move-on?\" Roger nodded his head in silent agreement. After their sprint for survival, the next door stood no more than a hundred feet from their current position. Roger looked around for the knife, and spotted it in the grass a little ways off to his left. He jogged over to retrieve it, deeply relieved. Somewhere in the back of his mind, it occurred to him that he had just had his first real brush with death. He shuddered, and felt his stomach lurch as the bread from earlier threatened to make a mad dash for daylight. The two companions soldiered on towards the second door, and whatever might lie in wait behind it.   # Martin clambered down from his horse to inspect a set of animal tracks in the dust. Removing one glove, he licked his finger and held it up to test the wind, which teased the long, greasy locks of hair under his wide-brimmed hat. \"More wolves,\" he said with barely concealed disappointment. \"If we have any hope of finding them, we'll need information on where that train is headed,\" Luther remarked, picking at a glob of mud stuck to his chaps.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 106 \"Don't you think I know that?\" Martin replied. \"We're running out of time.\" \"The tracks shouldn't be too far from here. We need to get moving or they'll get to Mother Florence's long before we find them. You know what Vladimir is apt to do if we fail, don't you?\"  Martin thought back to a time when they were just boys living on the farm that their father Edward had built on land they had purchased in the west. The harvest had been kind that year, but in the months that followed everything had suddenly seemed to wilt away. Their land dried up and became fruitless and barren, like the womb of a woman who could no longer bear children. Their father had been driven to madness by three straight years of failed crops, along with the disappearance of their baby sister Margie. He had hung himself with a length of rope that had once been used to lash together bulging bushels of wheat, once a symbol of their prosperity. Neighbors and friends formed search parties to comb the dusty prairie in search of their sister in the year before Edward had died, but to no avail. Eventually the search efforts ended, and they conceded that the girl had succumbed to exposure somewhere in the wilderness, or been picked off by one of the large predatory birds that often roamed the skies of the Realm. For them, a six-year old girl would seemed a very fine meal.      Certain types of wildlife that inhabit the Realm hold a very fearsome reputation.      For instance, the long-toothed jackrabbit, a creature that has been sighted with varying frequency by travelers and farmers alike throughout the years, feeds on young coyotes that are unfortunate enough to be caught out in the open without the protection of their much larger and fiercer parents. They say an adult jackrabbit can ambush a man with a leap of terrifying force, often resulting in limb or two lost to its\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 107 slobbering jaws. Such attacks have become rarer in recent years, with new restrictions and curfews enforced by Vladimir and his merry band of henchmen who patrol the area. Martin and Luther frequently participate in this kind of work.      Another animal that manages to instill a deep, abiding fear in the inhabitants of the Realm is the blue-tailed velociraptor, a flying menace that has been known on ocassion to pluck entire sheep from their pens, to be devoured in the caves and mountain lairs that they call home. Farmers often place wire mesh roofs over the areas where the livestock are kept as a precaution against just this issue, and parents are sure to keep a close eye on any small children that might be wont to go out and play during the bird's normal feeding time. Martin has an idea that just such a creature had carried off his sister all those years ago, and Luther might agree if you somehow managed to get him talking on the very touchy subject of her disappearance, but they well remember their father's rants about the rape of the land being perpetrated by Vladimir Cruor, and the likelihood that he had kidnapped her for \"some vile purpose out in that mansion of his.\" The boys were terribly frightened by their father's whisky-fueled ravings, which often turned into a drunken rage at a moment's notice, but holding such suspicions these days would be a very dangerous proposition indeed, given their current employer and his penchant for mind-reading. \"If they've already begun the process of putting in a request with the conductor to get dropped off at her campsite, it may already be too late to find the train. I've heard that once someone undertakes those three challenges, the train enters some other realm to make them possible and becomes invisible to any onlookers who might happen upon its previous location,\" Martin mused, more to himself than to Luther, who had begun to irritate him in the past few hours. The job was a high-stakes affair, he knew, though if\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 108 someone had asked him why, he would have had difficulty coming up with an answer. Something of deep importance to Vladimir, more so than any of the other errands they'd completed in the ten year history of their employment with him. \"Then we'll have to get to the campsite ahead of them some other way,\" Luther said. \"Aye. Nip the problem in the bud, like Dad used to say.\" \"How the hell are we gonna find that campsite without the conductor?\" Martin looked down at the tracks again. The dust had already begun to spin them into obscurity before his very eyes. Behind him, his steed whinnied impatiently. \"There are ways,\" Martin said, standing up to survey the plains once more with eyes that gleamed and sparkled like freshly cut diamonds.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 109               CHAPTER 12  Mother Florence was beginning to question her decision to continue with the story. Maisie was now clutching her brother with fear, but maybe that was a healthy fear; she looked like she enjoyed the thick suspense. The look on Hector's face was a mixture of embarrassment and concern at his sister's grip on his shoulder. Florence didn't usually like to tell scary stories, but something about that evening had brought on the urge to tell it. Somewhere in the middle of this tale she began to get another feeling in addition to the sense that the pair riding the train - good people - were on their way to see them and ask for my help. What struck her was a black sense of foreboding, thick and palpable like the air right before a thunderstorm, full of dark energy. She tried to shake it off but found herself unable to do so. More guests were on their way, but there was a white flash that went off in her head when she tried to identify the source of the aura. She had a terrible feeling that this new energy meant them great harm. She ignored it for the time being and went on: \"When the first child went missing - a little girl named Margaret - people thought that she had been carried off by one of the ravenous flying creatures that\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 110 populated the area. As you know, most of them have been nearly hunted to extinction, but in those days, thirty or forty years ago, the land was rife with them. No one in their right mind would let any child out to play after dark, because even if the birds didn't get them, the farmers and villagers had a strong feeling that there was something else lurking in the dark that presented an even greater threat. No one could say exactly what though. They started to come up with all kinds of stories to explain what might have happened to the girl, but no one suspected that Ivan had anything to do with it. Not at first, anyway. \"After a time, the search efforts were abandoned. No one would say that she died, out of respect for the poor thing's family, but everyone pretty much knew anyway.\" The children's eyes had grown to the size of dinner plates. Some force had taken hold of Mother Florence, though, and she seemed to have little recourse but to go on with the story. For whatever reason, imparting this tale to them had become of the utmost importance. She felt a little guilty, but go on with my story. I'll tell it to the end - at least, the end of what little I know regarding the true nature of these affairs I'm describing. \"The girl's father, Edward, went mad,\" she went on. In fact, Florence had known the man, and remembered him with fondness. He had been a friend, but his sons Martin and Luther had always seemed destined for trouble following a series of family tragedies. But could anyone blame them for what they became after such suffering? \"Meanwhile, Ivan sat in his mansion, musing on how to increase his farm's output even past its already record-breaking numbers, when he was visited by a young woman who was not of this Realm. She had come from another faraway land, traveling by tree-portal, and upon arriving she found that she knew no one, and had little idea of\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 111 where to settle down and start a family. She knew what she was doing - that wasn't the issue - but she had had to leave her old home in a hurry when the father of her children became violent and threatened her life, and the lives of her son and daughter. One night, when she knew the travel lanes were open for movement between the various Realms that make up our universe, she bundled her babies up in warm blankets and set out under the cover of darkness. When she arrived in the new place, she found herself standing right in front of that enormous, cold building that Ivan called home.\" \"What happened next, mama?\" Hector asked. He seemed to be much more into this story than his sister, who is all but trembling with fear. Is it so strange that I'm enjoying this? \"Well, the woman had stories before arriving at that place. Her friends had told her, 'Don't go! Things aren't right over there, somehow...' but she knew she had to get away and start a new life for herself, and for the sake of her children.\" She leaned over to stroke Maisie's hair as she spoke, and thought about how dear she was to her. How dear they both were. The little girl calmed perceptibly at her touch. \"She hadn't any idea that Ivan might be behind some of the bad things that had been happening in the area, and of course was unacquainted with him to begin with. Only later would she learn his true nature, but at that time she felt confident and optimistic, and went marching right up to what would turn out to be Ivan's front door. On the door was a large brass knocker, with which she gave three sharp knocks. \"Almost at once Ivan appeared at the door, as though he had been standing there waiting for her. She was startled at first, but he calmed her down with soothing words and a beguiling charm that helped her feel at ease. Then, he invited her into the house.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 112 \"Everything seemed normal as she crossed the threshold into the stranger's home. There was nothing to tell her 'beware!', nothing that might indicate some plot afoot. He gave her coffee and some biscuits and read poems to her to make her feel safe. She made herself at home and listened with genuine interest. It was when he began to make strange proposals that she grew uneasy. First, there were questions. \"'What do you fancy in a man?' he asked. \"'I don't rightly know. It seems as though the last man I thought seemed decent turned out to be an unreliable miser without one good bone in his body,' she replied with confidence. \"'You've got a bit of spark to you,' said Ivan. 'I wonder, have you any children?' \"'Yes, two,' she said. 'I love them very much.' \"'Where are they now?' he asked \"'At home, sleeping. They have yet to truly adjust to life in this new place, this Realm as everyone seems to call it. I have no doubt that they'll find it to be quite suitable after some time goes by.' \"'Yes, indeed. One can hope, at any rate!' \"He laughed at this last bit and continued to offer me - er, that is, Ivan continued to offer the woman his hospitality, and they conversed late into the night. \"'I have no doubt that you make a very fine mother,' he said at last, after the lady and Ivan had had some nips of brandy to begin winding down the evening. 'I suspect you also find that your life lacks something... essential, do you not?' \"The woman didn't know just how to respond to this strangely personal question. She sat back in her chair to consider it a moment. 'I'm afraid I don't have much idea of what you're talking about,' she finally answered.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 113 She realized that she no longer much cared whether this story was too frightening for Hector and Maisie. This is my story, and I intend to tell it to its final word. It's as if something powerful has taken hold of me, and I cannot stop the words from flowing forth. I expect by morning they'll be wondering whether or not I actually went so far as to traumatize them with what I really hadn't meant to be anything more than a rather light fairy tale to send them off to the Sandman. Things don't always turn out the way you planned, though. If living in the Realm has taught me anything worthwhile, I suppose it's that. \"Well, go on mama, what happened after that?\" A surprising glimmer of enthusiasm from Maisie, who had loosened her clutch on Hector's arm somewhat, to his apparent relief. He rubbed absently at the spot, massaging away the indents of her grip.\"What did he say to her next?\" \"The old farmer, Ivan - for in fact he had begun to get on in years, and the youthful charm and looks that had once complemented his generous personality had disappeared just the same as his benevolence had when he discovered that gaping hole in his heart. In fact, that had always seemed to be the source of his problems, even in spite of all his wealth and successful farming. He had searched so long for happiness, and even then it eluded him. He wanted so much to say the right thing, perhaps warm this woman's heart and have her desire to share his bed - but it was never to be. \"As she sipped her tea, she slowly began to realize that something was not right in the house. He kept looking at her during awkward pauses in the conversation (which were rather frequent, to her chagrin) and drumming his fingers on the upholstered arm of his satin couch, as if waiting for her to drop to her knees and propose to him.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 114 \"'It's true that you're new to the Realm,' he said, 'and I'm sure things are all very hectic right now. But have you ever considered taking a new husband?' \"The beautiful damsel found this to be very forward, and had already seen the way he was looking at her. His eyes resembled those of a wolf who might speak to a lamb, convincing her that he knows a shortcut to the way home, only he plans on slaughtering her when the opportunity presents itself. She felt decidedly uneasy. Something told her that it was time to leave. \"'I'm very tired,' she said, 'but I'm awfully far from home. I left my children in a tent near the entrance to the portal, and tomorrow I'm planning to bring them over and begin arranging our settlement in this place.' \"'Would you care to stay in one of my guest rooms?' he asked. 'It's very comfortable, and my servants will attend to your every need.' \"'That's very kind of you,' she said. 'Are you sure that'd be all right?' \"'Why, certainly, I suppose so, why not?' \"'It's awfully generous.' She yawned. \"'Don't mention it. I know how dangerous it can be out there on the plains after dark. You really shouldn't be going anywhere at all at this point.' \"Something in his tone made her uneasy - that is, building on the feeling that had already begun to heighten several minutes prior - but she knew there wasn't much choice when it came to walking across the plains after the sun had fallen. Those long-toothed jackrabbits could tear a woman apart in seconds, as she well knew. She agreed to stay in the guest room. \"He led her to a partition of the house that was closed off by a large black door at the end of a corridor; she could tell it lay somewhere in the middle, and as they\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 115 ascended the steep, torch-lined stone staircase that ultimately led to her temporary quarters, it became clear that she would be sleeping in some kind of tower. He left her alone to cast off her dusty traveling garments and lie in the large straw bed, the sheets of which some thoughtful manservant had managed to fold back into an inviting triangle of cotton linen.\" Hector had a sleepy glaze over his eyes, and Maisie doesn't look like she can stay up much longer, but I know that the story will end soon. There was only a bit left to tell, and Florence thought they could last five more minutes.   # Daniel leaned back in his chair and touched the lit end of a match to his pipe. Isaac and Cassius sat across from him at the kitchen table, staring back in that intense way that Daniel supposed all three of them shared. They waited patiently for him to speak. \"What you're talking about is treason and would no doubt lead to our execution should we be caught,\" Daniel said, weighing his words carefully. \"And what real reason do we have to go after those boys, anyhow? Guilt? I seem to recall you being rather ecstatic when Vladimir paid us for that last delivery, the last successful one, which by the way was over ten summers ago.\" The frowns that now creased their foreheads were identical. Sometimes Daniel could barely tell them apart. \"Things have been going from bad to worse for a while now, a fact that maybe you seem to conveniently forget when the pay is good, just like the rest of us. But we both\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 116 feel that something should be done. The tyranny has gone on too long, in our opinion,\" Isaac said. \"Bad to worse is right, but it's not as though Vladimir controls every last square of land in the Realm; he merely influences it by being a medium for something higher. There's something else that's been going on in the Realm. If we revolt, you think that will fix everything? The problems won't go away overnight, lads.\" \"It'd be a start,\" Cassius grumbled. \"With Vladimir out of the way, the Realm could finally breathe again. People wouldn't be living in fear any longer. And we'd be heroes,\" Isaac added. \"There's no way we could get to him, and even if we did his powers are vastly superior to ours. I'm afraid we wouldn't stand a chance,\" Daniel replied. \"But maybe that's just it!\" Isaac chimed in. \"What if Vladimir has spent his life convincing everyone in the Realm that he is a being of unlimited power and could strike them down with the flick of a finger, when in reality he's just a gnarled old man who knows a good trick or two, but is hardly immortal. Maybe he is a conduit to a higher power, but if we take his place, that line of communication will belong to us.\" \"You're talking about a bunch of old wives' tales,\" Daniel said, although he appreciated his brother's fervor. \"I'd like to do something about this whole mess too, don't get me wrong, but things aren't as simple as they seem. If Vladimir dies, things could fall apart completely. He's been around for decades, and in all that time, no one has ever challenged his seat of power. Why? What could be keeping everyone in fear?\" \"Maybe it's the company he keeps,\" Cassius suggested. \"All those people who claim to 'work' for him - they're some of the slimiest sorts you can imagine. That disgusting pet he keeps around the basement, for instance.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 117 \"Imagine that poor boy, locked up alone down there for everyone to look at. Why does he always put them in the dungeon?\" Isaac said. \"Probably scares them senseless,\" replied Daniel. \"I have little doubt that several of Vladimir's freakish 'employees' have already dropped by to pay him a visit,\" Cassius added. Daniel paused, drumming his fingers on the table. He was surprised to find he was seriously considering it. Were they to do something about Vladimir Cruor, it would require a monumental effort. Return the boys safely back through the portal that Vladimir had essentially used to kidnap both of them, and in doing so risk their very lives by attempting to dethrone Vladimir in the process? It actually doesn't sound that bad in my head when I chew it over like that, but again there's the whole all-but-certain-death side of things, which I have to say I'm not crazy about. \"All right boys, I guess I'm in. What we need now is a plan.\"  # \"Percy, I swear, if the next two boxcars are going to be anything like that last one, you can count me out,\" Roger exclaimed. I blushed a little at having cursed (or, using the Lord's name in vain, I guess the adults called it), but I found myself wanting to use certain words that I'd heard about in school. The desire to use expletives seemed to coincide with the increasingly stressful situations I was being forced to deal with.  Shit was probably the worst one I knew, except for that legendary one that started with F, of which I didn't know the meaning, or whether I'd even heard it correctly, and either way I probably lacked the courage to say it out loud. The second door had already yawned open, showing nothing but darkness. They had decided to pause for a minute to catch\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 118 their breath, which came out in ragged gasps after the helter-skelter sprint down the hill, before proceeding forth.      \"Shouldn't ... talk ... like that,\" he wheezed. I immediately felt embarrassed. \"Seriously, are we going to die on the next one? Because we sure as hell - er, heck - came this close to being eaten alive back there. If I get killed, who's going to save George? I'd rather go back and find him on my own, if this is going to lead to me losing my head trying to see some old woman I know nothing about!\" Roger's voice rose sharply at the end, and he suddenly realized he was on the verge of tears. Percy only stared back at him with a glum expression, his breathing now back under control. \"Are you finished?\" Percy asked. Roger felt his anger dissipate and conceded he had nothing else to say for the moment. \"Good. Now I'm pretty sure the next task won't be quite as bad. It was a good thing you had that knife in your pocket, although it makes me trust you a little less, considering you were armed this whole time and didn't see fit to tell me about it. But we've got to keep moving forward. What do you say?\" \"All right. You first,\" Roger said. \"Right, I suspected as much. Well, off we go then.\" Without another word, Percy stepped into the opening.       # \"Percy? Everything okay in there?\" Roger called out. The raven had disappeared from sight as though he'd just stepped behind a black curtain.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 119 \"Just fine! Come on through, it's safe, I think.\" His voice sounded oddly distant. \"Don't be scared, come on through!\" Drawing a deep breath, Roger did as he suggested. As he moved through the door, a stiff breeze ruffled his hair and cooled his face, as if he had just walked across the mouth of a cavernous wind tunnel. All he could see was darkness. Then, a hazy picture of what lay around them drew into focus. He could hear the sound of water dripping onto wet stone, and could make out jutting rock formations that gave off a faint, greenish gleam. Slick cavern walls surrounded us, and Roger turned around to discover the door had disappeared. It had been replaced by more smooth rock. The place looked as though it had remained undisturbed for thousands of years, if not longer. Roger and Percy found themselves standing on a narrow ledge some distance above the bottom of the cavern, and they could hear a curious rushing sound. Roger inched closer to the edge of the precipice, and, craning his neck, peered over. The source of that sound was none other than a swirling, black river, which frothed and churned with rapids. He swallowed hard and had to step back as a minor wave of vertigo swept over him. I remembered my Dad talking about something called vertigo the last time we had gone on a mountain hike together, although at the time I had only known 'vertigo' as a character from a Sega game called Primal Rage. I understood it now, though; my legs felt like they had been cobbled together with paper clips and chewing gum, and I scrambled back from the edge. \"Feeling all right, son?\" Percy asked with genuine concern. \"Yes, just got light-headed there for a minute. That's a long way down.\" \"Indeed. I would recommend staying away from the edge from now on, as a precaution.\" This sounded like sage advice to Roger.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 120 \"So, where do we go?\" he asked. Percy pointed his good wing to the right, showing a path that grew out of the ledge they were on. The narrow shelf of rock curled around and appeared to lead deeper into the cavern. \"Stay close to the wall,\" Percy said, although Roger couldn't see that they had much choice in the matter. The rock shelf that they had to walk on was about two feet wide at most. Percy would have no trouble, but Roger knew he would have to keep his back pressed flat against the rock face to keep his balance. That, and not look down. Roger's sneakers squeaked ominously on the slick surface as the pair began to inch along. He steeled himsef, and kept moving forward. What else is there to do? It sure as hell doesn't look like you can exactly take back your decision to start this whole process. Sure, maybe you think George was a little stupid for going out into the woods alone at night and getting sucked into that portal, but he's your little brother, and you're going to get him out of this mess, one way or the other. It's nobody's fault.      I repeated the last line in my head several times as a kind of mantra while I shimmied along behind Percy, my hands pressed flat against the smooth surface to my right.      \"Percy,\" he hissed, \"where are we going?\"      \"Forward, for the time being. Maybe things will get clearer up around the bend.\" \"Percy, I don't like this place. If we fell in that river, we'd drown like rats. You too, with your wing.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 121 \"Don't you think I know that?\" he snapped. Maybe Percy had a temper, too. His yellow feet looked to be having an equally difficult time maintaining their purchase on the slippery rock. \"Just concentrate on keeping away from the edge and moving slowly.\" They continued to make steady progress and soon arrived at the first bend. The river roared below. It was then that Roger saw the torches, and the caves. \"Percy, what is this place?\" he whispered, his voice quaking. \"Try to stay calm son, and keep moving. I was a little afraid of this.\" \"Afraid of what, exactly?\" \"I've heard stories about the... things that live in the second boxcar,\" he said. \"What kind of things?\" he asked, not sure that he really wanted to know. \"Things that live here and feed off the darkness like vampires,\" Percy said. \"If we stay on the ledge, we should be all right.\" \"I think I can hear something moving,\" Roger said, and indeed he could. It sounded like the patter of mice he sometimes heard coming from the walls of his house on a cold winter night. As they squinted into the gloom to look at the arched cave entrances cut into the stone, short, hunched-over creatures began to emerge. Beneath their hoods Roger could see no faces. The torches cast a flickering light that made the stones gleam on their side of the ravenous chasm. The black water churned steadily on below. Roger stifled a scream as a hissing sound filled his ears. It sounded like a chorus of a thousand people whispering violent threats and vitriol under their breath. They're calling out to us, he thought, but something tells me this isn't what you'd call a warm\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 122 welcome. More and more of the robed figures continued to spill out of their dark nests, until it seemed like an endless number of them lined the walls. \"Percy,\" he murmured, \"what if there are some on our side?\" \"Just keep walking, everything will be all right.\" \"What are they going to do to us?\" \"You don't want to know, trust me.\" \"Percy, come on, seriously, you have to tell me what those things are capable of.\" \"They'll drain your life force faster than one of the Grimsrud brothers can drain a mug of beer, okay? As long as we keep walking and don't make eye contact, everything should be fine.\" This caused Roger to snap his eyes to the ledge in a hurry. He scurried along faster, almost jostling Percy in an effort to push the pace. \"Careful now! You'll run me over, or worse, send your damn fool self tumbling down into that gorge,\" he said. There was anger in his voice. Roger realized that he could sense his own blood getting hot again, and suddenly he felt an inexplicable urge to draw back and plant a good kick straight into the miserable bird's wings, sending him down to the waters below. A squawk of surprise would be his last words. Roger lurched forward as if in a trance, the sound of the water growing louder in his ears. His shoulders slumped, and his head seemed to sway as if it were tied to several balloons being buffeted about in a strong wind. He realized his senses were beginning to fall away from him, and he gave his head a brisk shake, like a fatigued driver trying to stay awake along a desolate stretch of highway. Percy looked back with a mixture of concern and impatience. \"Roger, are you all right?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 123 \"I... I just got dizzy again for a second, I'm fine.\" \"That's the second time that's happened since we stepped into this section. I'm afraid they might be having a bad effect on you.\" \"They...? Who?\" He was having trouble concentrating. \"The cave dwellers up there on the ledge, I think they might be affecting your mind. I admit it's been getting to me somewhat as well. Did you feel inexplicably angry just now, some urge - to hurt me perhaps? Well, did you?\" \"How did you know that? Percy, I would never hurt you. Something just came over me, it was like... it was in the air.\" \"That may be, but listen to me very carefully. You have to put up a shield. Put it up with your mind any way you can, so that they can't get in. Even if you just think to yourself shield...shield...shield... or imagine yourself taking cover behind a huge wooden buckler. It's better than nothing, you've got to try and remember a tongue twister or some other way to occupy your mind and cloak your thoughts.\" Roger's eyes registered the path in front of him as he walked along in step with Percy, slowly regaining his confidence. The wet roughness of the wall felt cool against his bare hands as he slid them along to keep balance.  (Keep repeating the song, don't think about anything else, head out on the highway, lookin' for adventure, don't think about anything else.) It was working. Roger no longer felt any anger. The shuffling procession of hooded strangers on the opposite wall had at last come to a halt, and they stood watching the duo. There was no denying the impression that their hissings were, in reality, death threats. Roger continued to fight what felt like a winning battle against the onset of terror and rage. For whatever reason, he started to\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 124 nervously grope around in his pockets and came across two quarters, which he supposed had probably been change from the last time he and George had ridden their bikes to the corner store to buy some chips and a couple bottles of Stewart's cream soda. He played with them anxiously, turning them over in his hands and having a random thought of that Batman nemesis Harvey \"Two-Face\" Dent, with the face of Lady Liberty clean on one side, scratched and disfigured on the other. Once, George and I tried to make our own versions of such a coin using some pennies and a rusty nail. \"What if they find a way to get across? Don't you think there might be a bridge around here somewhere?\" \"It's possible. But maybe that's their side, and for some reason they just... never come over here.\" Percy said this in a voice that made it sound plausible enough. \"Regardless of what they might be up to right now, our goal is to find the next door and pass through it, come hell or high water. And it looks like there's plenty of 'high water' to kill us both if we're not careful.\" As Roger had suspected earlier, the roaring sound in his ears was getting louder. He craned his neck over towards the edge as far as he dared, and to my horror realized that the river was rising. Slowly, but steadily, it was rising. I swallowed against the cold lump of dread that had formed in my throat.      \"Percy, the water's getting higher!\" \"Keep walking son, we're almost there, I think.\" The ledge had begun to slope down gradually, and appeared to be curling towards the river. If we continued on this course, the charging river was going to swallow us whole - if those robed things on the ledge don't get us first, that is.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 125 \"Roger, pay attention. Look down there.\" Roger shook himself out of his trance and raised his eyes what looked like a small strip of rough sand that led down to the water's edge. There, the waves lapped and frothed with the tide. Moored on the beach was a small boat that looked like a miniature version of a viking funeral ship. A tall, robed figure stood up at the helm, and I had to stop myself from taking a startled step backwards when I saw him, which would have likely sent me tumbling from the shelf. In spite of his fear, Percy shuffled forward until he was standing on the expanse of sand, and Roger rushed to join him, not wanting to spend another second on the rock shelf. He relaxed a bit when he felt the sure footing of his sneakers in the sand, but unease scurried through his mind like spiders as he gazed up at the figure standing before them. He remained perfectly motionless, the same blackness under his hood obscuring any facial features he may or may not have had. It might have been my imagination, or a trick of the light caused by the torches on the far wall, but Roger thought he could see two golden, flickering lights roughly where his eyes should be. The figure looked far away somehow, as though seen the wrong end of a telescope.  This one was considerably larger than any of the others that watched, hissing, from afar, and although I kept my mental shield up as Percy had instructed, I could make out yet another mind-voice piercing the fog in my brain: [To cross the river you must pay the toll...] Those golden eyes seemed to grow brighter as he registered these new thoughts, equally invasive, though unthreatening. \"Percy, are you picking up any of that?\" \"Yes... this must be the ferryman.\" \"What's his name, do you know?\" I asked. \"I believe his name is Charon.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 126   # Time seemed to have lost all meaning in the little cell that George now called home. Either Vladimir had completely forgotten about him, or the moments were dragging by at an even slower rate than he thought. He felt as though it had been days since they first stuck him down there, but through the tiny slit at the other end of the corridor, could still see daylight seeping through. If there was any correlation between the time of day in Carlisle, Maine, and how the hours passed in this place that everyone kept calling \"the Realm,\" I would have gotten here extremely early in the morning, since I left in the middle of the night, and those giant brothers trundled me off to Vladimir's house right away. So, perhaps it was mid-afternoon, but I had no way of knowing for sure. It was dark when I arrived, and at some point the sun must have risen - but was it the same sun that lit our days back home? Something told me I had not only traveled to another dimension, but to another planet as well. Nothing made sense. When time fails to matter or be measured in a meaningful way, I suppose that's when you can say you've really lost your bearings. Besides, I was terrified.  That hideous beast that had paid him a visit left nightmare visions waddling about in his brain like grotesque shadow puppets. There were black pictures of ugly things with piebald hides, shuffling along on their bellies and tasting the air with their tongues. How are you ever going to get out of here? he thought. What if something happens to Roger?  What if something already did happen?\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 127               CHAPTER 13  \"What happens next, mama?\" Maisie asked. Her eyes were still the size of golf balls, but she had apparently become enthralled with the story. Hector, too, sat listening with a fascinated look upon his face. \"Yeah, what did the prince do after he put her to bed in the guest room?\" he added. \"The prince had one of his servants bring her milk and honey to put her at ease and help her fall asleep, which she gratefully accepted. But as she lay her head down upon the silky sheets - a luxury she had never experienced, before or since - her mind began to wander to dark places, and some things the prince had said earlier seemed to come back to her, understood now in a darker light, though she couldn't quite put her finger on what she had detected in his tone, which had seemed so cordial over tea. That feeling refused to leave her, and consequently she found herself tossing and turning as the minutes ticked by. \"Meanwhile, Ivan had descended the stairs of the tower, going all the way down, past the first floor, and into the secret chamber where he kept perhaps one of the\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 128 greatest artifacts the Realm has ever known. It was a pool of water that lay in a curved stone formation, and with it he was able to keep an eye on all that belonged to him, which, at that time, was a sizable portion of the entire Realm itself. Some were areas known to the villagers, likely to be found on maps and so forth, and others that were unknown and yet to be discovered. Nonetheless, Vladimir had found a way to extend his influence to mysterious lands untraveled by our kind, populated instead by... others, and he took control of their livelihoods as well.\" \"Mom, I thought the evil prince's name was Ivan,\" Hector said. She shook herself from the trance of storytelling. \"What'd I say?\" \"Vladimir.\" \"Oh, sorry dear, my mistake. You're absolutely right, it's Ivan.    \"Anyway, the prince, Ivan, gazed deep into the reflecting pool, and asked it to show him the beautiful young woman he had bid good night just moments earlier. The water swirled and frothed, then settled. With the calming of the water, an image began to form: the woman, who had just left everything behind to come to the Realm and seek a better life, tossing and turning on her bed, helpless to fall asleep though she wanted nothing more. She was tired to the bone, but the thoughts wouldn't go away. What does he want from me? She thought, the words in her mind coming through in dark snatches that only caused her to sink deeper into despair. She felt a sudden urge to run from the house, setting out down the road to try and find shelter in the nearest village, though she knew this would be a dangerous undertaking. She decided to get up and have a look around the room.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 129 \"Ivan watched all this with growing interest, his wolfish eyes scanning her figure, probably while thinking impure thoughts.\" Hector gave her a quizzical look. \"He watched as she got out from under the covers and began pacing around the room, picking up objects and examining them: a comb on the dresser, a small decorative scarecrow doll that had been placed beside the mirror, and on the nightstand, a candlestick in an iron holder, red wax streaking down in long rivulets. He didn't really know what she was up to, but he enjoyed watching her unseen. It made him think he could do anything, and not worry about the consequences. \"At that point, she turned around and walked over to the bookshelf that stood in the corner of the room, which contained many volumes on agricultural technique, sharecropping, weather patterns, and the like. There was some fiction too, including several plays by Shakespeare. He was a very famous writer from planet Earth, and his works were so well-loved that the Librarians' Association of the Realm decided to send a few helpers across to import the writing. \"At any rate, he watched as she browsed the shelves, when a sudden thought occurred to him that he wondered why he hadn't had much earlier: I truly hope she doesn't suddenly develop an interest in Jack London, he thought, another author that had been deemed culturally significant, and some of his works were imported to the Realm. Ivan had several books by this man; in fact, Jack London was his favorite author, but she had no way of knowing that. The book that she so happened upon was one titled White Fang, which is a story about a wolf, an animal that we have in the Realm as well. Ivan watched her hand hover over a copy of Hamlet by Shakespeare, which she had heard some great things about, mainly in terms of the way it dealt with feminine\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 130 insanity, but the stark title of White Fang grabbed her attention, and she reached her hand higher to select it from the shelf. \"Instead of sliding out easily from in between the two other novels that flanked it, the bottom corner wouldn't budge, and the book tilted out at an angle when she pulled. This was immediately followed by a large clanking sound, then ratcheting gears as the entire bookcase swung away before her astonished eyes. \"Little to her knowledge, Ivan had already called one of his most faithful servants to handle the breach of security that this meddlesome woman had unwittingly caused. The creature he called upon to chase the woman out of the house was not a man, but a combination of several animals that he had enchanted to do his bidding. It was a cross between a rat, a pig, and a snake, so large that it had to drag itself along on its belly with its scrabbling claws, its thick tail trailing out behind. \"What the lady saw behind the bookcase looked, at first glance, like an ordinary child's bedroom. Judging from the blue wallpaper, she guessed a boy's. A comfortable-looking, if rather dusty, cot stood in the center of the tiny room, which was really no bigger than a closet. It smelled of moth balls. What her eyes settled upon, however, was the pile of what looked at first like dirty rags in one corner. Slowly, like a woman in a dream, she stepped through the opening behind the bookcase. \"She leaned over to examine the rags. Some of them were stained a dirty brown, the color old and caked. When she got closer, she realized that it was clothing; dozens of shirts for little boys, probably between the ages of eight and thirteen. \"Suddenly, a powerful horror seized her and she swung about in a dizzying spin, trying to find the way out of the room that held such unspeakable terror. There, on the wall, was a blue elephant holding a balloon. A mobile with strange flying machines spun\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 131 round and round above the cot with no occupant. There were also scores of black bootmarks on the floor, lots of different sizes. They made no sense, unless... unless the people who made them were struggling. One seemed bigger than all the rest, and that, right there... were those animal tracks? \"At that moment, she finally whirled into place and the two foot gap beside the bookcase came into view. She ran for the exit - but it was too late. The evil prince's favorite servant curled its loathsome head around the corner, its tongue flicking out to taste the air, and she knew it could smell her. Its eyes were gray and lifeless, and the white, matted fur on its fat side shone with some kind of oil. She froze in fear, her heart thudding dully in her chest. \"Do you want me to go on?\" Florence asked her children softly. They nodded, but with hesitation, as if the beast Florence had seen all those years ago might be lurking just beyond the edge of their campsite., and she knows it probably won't go away later on. Of course, I'm the young lady in the fairy tale, and they're probably wondering how I'm managing to come up with so many details for what should have been a brief bedtime story. For whatever reason, telling them this story seems very important this evening.  \"Well, the woman was so terrified that she leapt through the gap by the bookcase and only really got to look at the creature for a split second on her way out the door. Then, she fled down the stairs of the tower and outside through the front exit. Somehow, the house's maze-like hallways had allowed her to make a quick escape, as though the prince wanted her to leave and the house had somehow organized itself to make the route clear.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 132     \"Once outside, she tasted the crisp night air and heaved a sigh of relief. She had escaped. The prince had acted kindly enough, she thought, but what did that room mean? I suppose at that time she knew - the stories about children disappearing in the Realm had been passed around for years, traveling by hearsay to other dimensions as well. It was not surprising that she had also heard the rumors about the children who never came home from playing to eat dinner with their families. They were mostly boys who disappeared, but she remembered hearing about one or two cases of a girl vanishing. It wasalways the same story: no one saw her taken, and no one took her; she was just gone., And for some reason that bizarre fact made her extra uneasy when she would hear the morbid bits of gossip, back when it was just beginning to happen and people were still insisting that a number of search parties be formed in order to find the children. They never turned anything up though - not until her own discovery in the prince's house, that is. \"She fled from him, and no one chased after her, but she didn't feel safe until she had made it to the doors of an inn at the neighboring town. She begged for help, telling them that there was a monster living at the old mansion on the outskirts of the plains to the west, but when people realized what house she was talking about, they immediately cut her off to say that they 'wouldn't be able to provide any assistance,' but if she'd like a warm room in the inn, they'd be happy to accommodate her. \"Protesting half-heartedly, she relented to let them lead her upstairs. Once down with a feather pillow underneath her head, she no longer had any trouble falling asleep, as her nerves were taxed and her body exhausted. She fell into a deep slumber, sleeping for almost a day and a half. When she awoke, she went downstairs to converse with the innkeeper, who was going about his business as on any other day. And why shouldn't\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 133 he? She felt that something had to be done about the terrible secret that she had glimpsed, like a forbidden jewel kept in a locked box, but they would hear none of it, and the innkeeper even began to grow angry when she had timidly tried to bring it up again. She knew then that no one would help her, and her best bet would probably be to just move along and mind her own business. She managed to gather a few belongings through the charity of the people in town, who pitied her, and then set out on the plains, armed only with a few weak safety enchantments that could protect her, should any wild animals threaten her progress, or her life. She constructed a new portal to transport her children across, knowing that they could never return, lest they face perhaps an even greater evil in the children's father, and they made their home on the plains, never to return to that house, and making a living by providing wayward travelers with a warm place to sleep in their guest tent, or helping with various problems: some were physical, and the woman had been trained as a doctor some time ago, using enchantments to heal such afflictions as mumps, measles, and planter's warts, but others had larger problems, to which she applied sage advice, and not infrequently some magic remedies to ease the situation as best she could. \"Thus they lived, and continue to live to this day, but the thoughts of that black house never really left the woman's mind, and she wondered if there might come a day when she would be called upon to return... either voluntarily, or otherwise.\"      This seems like a strange place to end the story, but I haven't anything left to tell, and the children look ready to pass out in each other's arms. Hector's eyelids flutter, as if some invisible hand is pressing down upon them. \"So the lady lived happily ever after?\" Hector asked.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 134 \"Yes, my love. She and her children live happily ever after, because they know that all they'll ever need is each other, and that love that binds us... er, I mean them.\" \"That was a good story mom, I liked it,\" Maisie said, barely still awake. \"I'm sleepy.\" \"Me too, dear, it's very late.\" The children curled up under the blanket together, and before a full minute had passed they were both fast asleep. Florence gazed at them with adoration for a moment longer, then left the tent to stand outside and stare out into the night. A faint blue aura glimmered around the edge of the campsite, and she was glad for the warmth and safety that it provided their humble home. She strained her ears to catch any sounds, expecting to pick up only the lonely howl of a coyote, or perhaps the mating grunts of a wild jackrabbit. Instead, what she heard were thundering hoofbeats. Her heart sank like a broken elevator. She knew who it was.  # \"Percy, I'm scared. What are we supposed to do? Those things are still trying to take over my thoughts.\" \"Hang on kid, keep the shield up, and stay calm. All he wants is the fare, and then we can cross and get to the last boxcar.\" \"Fare?\" \"Yes. Two coins of equal value must be exchanged for passage across the River Styx.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 135 Roger thought back to his unit on ancient Greece that had involved an abridged reading of the Odyssey. He hadn't paid as much attention as he probably should have, but the River Styx stood out clearly in his mind. \"Percy... are we in the Underworld?\" Roger asked. His voice trembled. \"Some people call it that, yes,\" Percy said. Roger swallowed hard. His legs felt rubbery, and he could sense Charon's intense stare on his face, as though he were sitting too close to a campfire.      \"Pull yourself together son. We need to figure out how to pay the fare.\" Roger suddenly had an idea. He dug around in his pocket and felt the two quarters he'd grabbed off the nightstand before he left. He wondered whether the things staring at them from the opposite ledge were, in fact, dead. \"What's in your hand?\" Percy asked. Roger showed him the quarters, and the bird's yellow eyes lit up. \"Seems as though you might have saved the day for the second time, my friend,\" he said. Roger heard a strong note of affection in his voice, and realized he cared about his feathered companion a great deal as well. \"Go give him the coins, Roger. You can do it.\" His shaking legs carried him towards the bow of the vessel. The surging rapids seemed to have abated somewhat. Perhaps the robed figures controlled that, too. Roger tried not to lower the shield he had constructed in his mind, but their thoughts tickled his brain like so many fingernails. He kept moving, undeterred. His palms sweated freely and he hoped the coins didn't slip out of his hand.  Roger held out his hand.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 136 The helmsman's hooded face peered down to review the fare, and for a moment Roger thought that he'd refuse to accept the coins. A skeletal hand slid out from under his sleeve, and plucked the quarters from his sweating fingers, the bones rasping against Roger's skin for a split second. The touch left him feeling woozy and somehow in shock. He deposited the change into a large pocket sewn into the front of his robe. The twin lights under his hood where his eyes should have been seemed to sparkle brighter for an instant as he did so. With the fare now paid, Roger felt a warm glow enter his mind. With a broad sweep of his left arm, which revealed his other skeletal hand, he granted them access to the vessel, and with it safe passage to the opposite bank.      Though the shield Percy had instructed me to raise remained in place, I could sense a change in the attitude of our ominous observers clustered on the ledges and outside of cave entrances on the cliffs that rose above the river. Percy and Roger moved forward like sleepwalkers and stepped gingerly over the bow and into the boat, taking seats on a bench behind the ferryman, who remained standing, eyes forward all the time. Without a word (Roger certainly hadn't expected him to say anything, but the silence was unnerving nonetheless) he reached down to retrieve a very long oar from a rack built into the gunwale. He hefted it over the side and pushed off hard from the shore. The white bones of his forearms gleamed dully in the darkness. The boat slid backwards into the water, and Roger immediately felt the current swing them around to aim at the opposite shore. Charon skillfully manipulated the course by plunging his oar into the foaming waters. Roger held fast to the lip of the bench with both hands, and glanced at Percy to make sure he was all right. He covered his beak with one wing in a pretty good imitation of a person who might be about to\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 137 hurl. His eyes seemed to grow more fearful with each passing second as the ferry listed nauseatingly from side to side. The ferryman's footing remained solid throughout.  It occurred to Roger that these beings in the caves probably relied on the ferryman for transport on a regular basis. Which brings us to our next little realization, Roger old boy. Or should I say next recollection? Because you remember what Charon's job really was, don't you? You aren't in the Underworld until you cross the river. Charon brings you across when you die. The things on the ledge? They only needed him once. They're all dead Roger, every last one of them. Percy looked at me with a kind of fascinated terror and I realized he had probably been listening in on my thoughts. I wondered how much he might know about Greek mythology, but it looked like my epiphany had come as a bit of a shock to him either way. I was comforted by one other thought: in Greek mythology, several of the heroes managed to pass into the underworld on Charon's ferry to complete various missions, but they were able to escape again with their lives in spite of the tremendous danger. Orpheus was one. But he messed that one up pretty badly, didn't he. He couldn't help glancing backwards just once to make sure his wife was really behind him, breaking the only rule he needed to follow to get her out of there. I wondered if I would have enough faith to press on in that sort of situation - enough faith to get Georgie back home. We'll just have to wait and see, won't we? Percy still looked like he was about to lose his lunch, but Roger felt more or less all right, considering. The voices had stopped trying to gain access to his mind, it seemed, and he even let his mental shield slip down a bit, like a knight who'd been pelted with arrows and needed to see if the barrage had ended. He concentrated on the\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 138 crests of white water that appeared amidst all that black. Charon guided the boat down the slope of each wave. \"Don't touch the water, Percy!\" Roger said. He started to say something, then finally vomited on the floor of the boat. A few soggy blobs of bread and some half-chewed earthworms lay drying in a sticky mess on the floorboards. \"Feel better?\" That time, Percy did nod, and emphatically. The opposite bank was approaching faster than they might have guessed at first. The river was no more than a hundred meters across at its widest point. We were moving at a rather alarming clip, although the course was more of a zigzag than a direct line, given the strength of the current, and I wondered how he was going to dock this thing when all I could see on the opposite side was a sheer rock wall. \"Percy, I think we have to retrieve something on the other side, then travel back across the river on this boat in order to pass on to the next challenge,\" I said, having to shout a bit over the water's roar. \"That's how it's always worked in the stories. I'm guessing it's a key, or some other way to make the door visible, back there where we started out.\" I felt confident, like I was beginning to get the hang of these \"challenges.\" Maybe they're custom-made, I thought. They all have solutions that touch you somehow: cutting that thing's flower off with the knife that Dad just happened to give you the night before, and now the River Styx - perhaps not the real River Styx, but maybe only a simulation or hologram, like the Holodeck on the Starship Enterprise. But if that were true, how could a boxcar run such a complex program? It occurred to me not\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 139 for the first time that I had in fact arrived on an alien planet, presumably located several galaxies away from my own. To their amazement, the ferryman was able to swing the oar out of the water and pull them in as they approached the low bank. Also, the river itself seemed to have settled down noticeably. Perhaps it only got agitated when travelers were preparing to cross - or, it might have had more to do with our invasive status in the eyes of the cave-dwellers whose side we're now on, I thought. As Percy and Roger climbed out and found our footing on the narrow ledge, they suddenly looked up to see them. The robed figures stared down at the pair with eyes that glimmered with the same light as the ferryman's. He held us in place with a steady hand on the oar, which was locked into a stone notch seemingly built for the purpose. \"Roger, look!\" He did, gazing up ahead on the path that was really more of a stone staircase flanked by huge grey boulders. It reminded him of another Greek myth that had captured his imagination:  the one about Sisyphus, the king of Thessaly who was forced to roll a giant rock up a steep incline to watch it tumble back down to the bottom again for all eternity. The hill that stood before them was the spitting image of what Roger had imagined in his mind while reading. He didn't like the looks of it one bit, and wondered what it would really be like to get stuck in an endless task like that - and whether that might be a dangerous possibility in this situation that Percy and I now found ourselves in. A small yellow object gleamed dully at the top of the stony hill, catching his attention, but he couldn't quite make it out. \"Percy, do you see that thing up there?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 140 \"Yep, it's a key, just as I suspected.\" He kept forgetting not to underestimate Percy's eyesight. \"You think we can just walk up there, grab it, and take the ferry back to the other side?\" Roger wondered aloud. A booming voice suddenly filled his head, and he had to plant his hands on the wall to keep from stumbling backwards in surprise.  \"To pass through this arena you must retrieve the key and return from whence you came,\" the deep voice said. \"A new door will carry you through, but only if you are strong of heart, and sound of mind. Only a true hero can take the key - one who would sacrifice his life for the good of another. You must be willing to take this leap if you are to leave these halls alive.\" I knew Charon was addressing us, but I found that I was completely unable to turn around and actually look at him. It was as though a pair of invisible hands were holding my head in place to prevent my neck from swiveling. He went on: \"Roll the boulder at the foot of the hill to the top. Once this task has been completed, hold it in place to access the key. You must not drop the boulder before the key is in your hands, or you will be trapped here as living souls amongst the dead forever.\" At the bottom of the hill there were indeed two huge boulders: one smaller, but awkwardly shaped, and the larger smooth and round - heavier, but likely easier to roll. \"Well Percy, you heard the man. What do you say we get to work?\" he said. \"You want to take the smooth one? I think I can almost move it by myself.\" \"I suppose, but you can't seriously believe that I'm going to be much help in this situation, do you?\" he replied. \"Let's find out,\" Roger said, cracking his knuckles.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 141 \"We need to be careful about how we proceed. That thing could roll over and crush me.\" \"Yeah, you and me both. Let's just try not to think about that.\" Roger laid his hands on the blue-gray rock and gave it a shove. It rocked easily in the slight indentation in which it rested. He pushed back harder, timing it with the forward momentum. The technique worked like a charm, and soon the boulder was free. He controlled it easily, maneuvering it into place at the very bottom of the steps. Through the center of the stairway there was a kind of groove that appeared to be designed for the purpose of rolling boulders. In fact, the whole thing seemed constructed for this purpose alone, and he wondered if Sisyphus might not be off somewhere nearby, having a cigarette break or something while Charon set this up for us. He centered the boulder and found his footing on the left side of the stairs while motioning for Percy to take up position on the right. He obediently got into place, placing his one good wing on the rock. It hadn't occurred to Roger that he wouldn't be able to push with both wings, and he gave another withering look that left him feeling embarrassed and stubborn. \"I don't think this is going to work, son,\" he said in a dry voice. \"We have to try,\" Roger said. \"Let me see if I can move it on my own.\" He got a grip and began to push. The rock moved easily at first, and I got it about a foot up the narrow trough before it wouldn't go any farther. It had felt manageable a second ago, and now it wouldn't budge even one more inch. \"Percy, come on, let's see if it'll go any farther if we push it together.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 142 He begrudgingly laid his wing on the stone and tested it. Roger guessed he was adding no more than a pound or two of extra pressure on the rock, but to his great surprise, it did start moving. \"Percy, we're doing it!\" he shouted, overjoyed. The tiny extra bit of help that he was able to provide seemed to make all a major difference. aybe it wasn't the extra push that Percy could provide - that truly was insignificant - but I got the feeling that it was the fact that we were combining our strength that allowed us to progress up the hill with the boulder, which I now felt convinced was enchanted. \"If we keep pushing together, I think we can make it to the top,\" Roger gasped, almost out of breath. Percy was concentrating too hard on the task at hand to offer much of a reply, only sending out a wave of thought that I registered as agreement. Thoughts of Sisyphus struggling up the slope flooded his weary mind: his biceps standing out in rippling, stark relief, wearing a tattered loincloth soaked with sweat that clung to his wasted thighs, a ragged length of beard draped around his neck. Roger wondered how he looked, bending slightly to sniff at my armpits; at that time I was still too young to emit any truly offensive body odor, but my hygienic situation was far from pleasant. I had skipped a bath the night before, and had already been in the Realm for what felt like a year and a day - although in reality it has probably in fact been far less than a day, and your perception of time has pretty much lost all bearing on what your body may or may not be actually experiencing, regardless of your mind - but I was getting lost on a tangent when I needed to be concentrating on the task at hand. His palms only seemed to get slicker as the seconds dragged on, and he realized he had been just a hair away from losing his grip on the rock.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 143 He steadied himself and continued the climb; even with Percy's somehow critical contribution, it was exhausting, mind-numbing work, and his muscles already ached fiercely. The top of the hill seemed like an infinite distance above, and seeds of doubt had already begun to work their way into Roger's brain like hungry earthworms. He did his best to prevent them from taking hold. Hot anger began to rise in his temples. [No, stop it Roger, it's those things trying to get into your head again! You have to concentrate; bring the shield back up before it's too late!] It was Percy, coming through on just the right frequency for Roger to hear him and heed his advice. He looked up just in time to see a robed creature reach down from a ledge and reach for his hair. He ducked, and his skeletal grip flailed wide, then almost tumbled straight off the ledge, which would have probably send the demon cascading back down the side of the hill and into the waters of the Styx. He doubted this would be a huge problem, considering the kid was already dead, but then again I didn't really want to find out. I knew it would mean the end of my little adventure, if it did manage to give my hair a yank and send me sliding helplessly into the water. Roger steeled himself as the thing appeared to gather itself for another vicious attack.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 144               CHAPTER 14  The Rangers swooped down on the campsite like a hurricane. Mother Florence stood in shock outside the tent, desperately trying to figure out how on earth they managed to find her. In fact, the boy Roger and his companion Percy were drawing very close to the old plain-dweller's campsite, which although nomadic in nature had been in the safe place for many years, and the energy signature it put out into the atmosphere had grown larger over that time until it registered in a wide berth over the surrounding area when the conductor needed to drop people off from the train. Anyone who wants to see her must pass through the three tests, she knows, and that has only happened once or twice in the last twenty years, but nevertheless, when someone or something approaches the successful completion of the tasks, her campsite emits a kind of homing beacon that can be picked up by friend and foe alike. Vladimir knew it was right to dispatch the Rangers when he did, she thinks. If they hadn't been nearby when the conductor was making his final approach, they would have missed their chance entirely. And now they're here. I must protect the children, she thought, but in her heart she knew it was already too late. The riders bore down with\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 145 terrifying speed. Florence turned to run back inside the tent, stumbling and wondering how they could have penetrated the force field.  That was when Luther grabbed the terrified woman by the high white collar of her nightdress and hauled her roughly off the ground. He squeezed the back of her neck so hard that she immediately began to lose consciousness. Meanwhile, Martin concentrated on destroying as much of the surrounding campsite as possible. The steed's iron-shod hooves threw up great clods of earth, and Martin feverishly urged the beast on as it snorted and whinnied, trampling everything in sight. Luther stood patiently off to one side, having already dismounted and bound Florence's arms and ankles with rope. Her body flopped over as he hefted her unceremoniously onto the rump of his horse. He knew who she was, and briefly worried that he might have hurt her, but orders were orders, and he intended to follow them to the letter. If they had hesitated, or held back even just a little, Florence might have had time to conjure an enchantment powerful enough to knock him off his horse and turn the tables completely around on them. He knew that brutal force and terror were so often the best way to get things done - because they got results.   When Martin finished ripping down every last inch of the settlement save for the tent where the children sat shivering with fear, Luther led his horse over and they prepared to take Maisie and Hector into custody. Martin dismounted as well, and uncurled a length of rope from the horn of his saddle. Through the flap in the tent they could see flames leaping up from a smashed gas lamp that Martin's horse had knocked over into a pile of hay, the heat caressing their faces. They huddled closer to one another, but were torn apart when Martin's horse ripped the tent in two beneath its relentless hooves. The children screamed, but before they could react any further Luther\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 146 scooped Hector up with one strong arm, planted him on the empty saddle, then lashed his legs together with rope until he was completely immobile. Martin did the same with Maisie, her mind blank with terror as he knotted it around her legs. This all took place in a matter of seconds, and although such events often seemed to stretch on endlessly in the minds of the Rangers' victims, Mother Florence perceived hardly anything, and the children are too shocked to form any memories of the kidnapping. With the campsite destroyed and their bounties gathered, the riders streaked out across the darkened plain, urging their horses faster with vicious kicks of their spurs, their human cargo bouncing violently.  They ride hard, and if someone were to watch them streaking by, they might be able to make out the faintest bit of white luminescence trailing off behind the horses. Night has fallen in the Realm once more, and this time there are no stars.  # \"Percy keep pushing I'm losing my grip!\" Roger gasped. Desperation clawed at his senses as he tried to keep from panicking. \"Relax, I just need a quick break,\" Percy replied, dusting off his chest-feathers. Then he actually leaned against the rock with his weight in the downhill direction. \"Percy, what are you doing?! I can't hold it for long without you, and it doesn't help that you're pressing on it in the wrong direction.\" Black fear streaked through him, and he glanced over his shoulder, expecting to see the same horrible robed figure make another attempt to grab him. To his surprise, it had disappeared, perhaps back through the entrance of one of the caves that lined the walls.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 147 [You're on their side now, and when you cross the river, boy, they can do whatever they want to you.] Charon's voice again. Percy jumped back from the boulder when he realized he was actually contributing to Roger's ensuing loss of grip on the slick surface. He laid his good wing - so useless-seeming when compared to the overall size of the boulder - on the rock and, incredibly, it seemed enough to stabilize the whole operation. For some reason, with Percy helping, the task was somehow manageable, in a this-can't-be-happening-unless-it's-magic sense. It seemed clear that his participation was a critical piece of the puzzle, a puzzle that we'd need to solve or die trying if we were to have any hope of making it on to the next boxcar. \"Look, you really have to help me with this, it won't work without you. There's some sort of enchantment so I can't do it by myself.\"      \"You're right, I'm sorry, I really just lost my breath for half a second. It's tough staying on guard all the time with those things hovering around.\" His eyes held a terror that I had already seen once, when the creature in the previous section had risen out of the earth and almost eaten us alive.      Their progress employed the same technique that the tortoise had used to beat the hare, but it was anything but easy or pleasant. Minutes passed that felt like hours, but I could sense that this miserable job was nearing its end. Sisyphus would have to cut his break short, because I didn't plan on sticking around any longer than it took us to grab the key and get the hell out of here. [Getting comfortable with using the old profanity, are we?] This could have been me or Percy, it wasn't clear. Even though I hadn't actually said the word out loud, I felt my cheeks redden.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 148 In a fit of anger Roger redoubled his efforts to get the cursed boulder up the slope. It lurched forward, and with one final surge they at last arrived at the top. It settled into a notch that was similar to the one the boulder had started out in. Something felt unsteady about it, though, and Roger suddenly became fearful of having to hold the rock on his own, since Percy now needed to grab the key from the pedestal. He remembered Charon's warning: if they let the boulder roll back down the hill, they'd lose access to the key, and wind up stuck on the dead side of the Styx forever. He couldn't fail George and wind up trapped down there. He steeled his resolve and made a tiny adjustment to his grip on the rock. Percy held on, too. They both paused to think. Roger looked over to see the glimmering pedestal that he had glimpsed from afar when they had just disembarked from the ferry. It was a golden stand encrusted with jewels. The top was housed in a bell of glass. When he and Percy got the boulder in place, the dome slid back to reveal the key, free and clear of any other obstructions. It lay on a stand that was made of something Roger thought might be ebony, and the surface gleaming like a polished piano key. Percy immediately darted out from his position and hopped madly at the side of the table, the key just out of his reach. At that same instant, the rock throbbed backwards against Roger in a violent jolt that almost caused him to lose his balance and go tumbling backwards down the stairs to fall into the clutches of those robed freaks. \"Percy, I can't hold this thing much longer!\" Roger cried in desperation. He glanced back only for a moment before resuming his insane hop around the pedestal. \"Hang on, I've almost got it!\" With that, he sprang up and with extraordinary dexterity managed to pluck the key neatly from where it lay. Roger was busy summoning all his strength to keep the\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 149 rock in place, and it felt like his grip might give out at any second, but when Percy got the key, somehow the weight stopped pressing. He hesitantly stopped resisting what he thought would be the bringer of his death, and the enormous artifact remained steady. Percy hopped back as if nothing had happened, the key dangling from his beak. \"I got the key! Did you see that jump back there? Almost made me feel like I was flying again!\"  They stood at the top of the rocky mound carved there in the banks of the River Styx and Roger felt a strange itch, like he was in desperate need of something, that some void deep inside him had opened up. \"Percy, while you were busy hopping around, that thing almost crushed me. It needed the strength of us both to make it up the hill, however minimal your contribution may have been.\" \"I resent that. You said it yourself, you needed me. Now can we please get back to the other side of the river?\" \"Sounds good to me.\" They hustled down the slope without giving the clearing at the top a second glance. Roger was glad they were leaving; he could feel death closing in on them even as they ran. Indeed, the cave-dwellers continued to shuffle about on their perches, trying to get a better look at the travelers. However unconsciously, Roger managed to keep his mental shield up to prevent them from entering his thoughts, and it looked to him like Percy had done the same. The pair skidded to a stop at the bottom of the slope, which was fortunate since a few more inches would have sent them tumbling into the water. Charon was right where\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 150 they'd left him, apparently still waiting for them, and Roger felt a strange flood of gratitude towards him for staying put. Despite Roger's thoughts of Orpheus just moments earlier, he decided to throw one last glance backwards before boarding the boat with Percy, who had already hopped over the bow. The ferryman prepared to push off again with his long, black oar. What Roger saw when he turned his head was an old man - at least, that was what his eyes registered at first - but upon closer inspection what he saw was a monster. Skin draped off his bones in loose flaps, and his nails and beard grew long, ragged, and tattered. The flesh of his face was covered with dark, cancerous-looking spots. A stained loincloth was wrapped around his wasted thighs. Even from the bottom of the hill, the stench of him was almost unbearable: sweat, vomit, and urine wafted down in a cloud. [Stop it, it's just those things trying to get ahold of you, can't you see he's working with them? Stop looking at that man and get on the boat.] Roger did his best to obey this voice, but found himself unable to tear his gaze away from the demon now standing at the top of the hill, in all his misery; he actually seemed proud to be up there. Roger felt horrified by what he saw, but could not tear his eyes away. This was Sisyphus, a relic from the underworld whose task Roger and Percy had completed one single time, using all their strength and resources. As Roger watched, the old man laid one foot on the boulder, adjacent to the now-empty pedestal that once held a key - this was now receding into the ground like a reverse-growing orchid, emitting a bone-jarring rumble as it went - and gave it one massive shove. The thing took off like a shot and came crashing down the mountain, headed on a direct (and definitely promising to be lethal) collision course with the boat.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 151 \"Roger, get to the boat, hurry hurry now now now!\" Percy screamed at him. He did not need to be told twice. The boulder crashed down the hill with increasing momentum, certain to smash the boat to smithereens and obliterate its occupants.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 152               CHAPTER 15  \"Now son, I want to shoot straight with you here and tell you that we're gonna have to wait a little while before we can move you to your permanent quarters. I know it's dark and kinda scary down here, but at least it's warm, and most importantly, I know you're safe. I've had Mandrake bring down a few extra blankets for you. And a jigsaw puzzle.\" Vladimir nodded at Mandrake, who was standing at attention on one side, the gifts in hand. \"I carved it myself, master George.\" He held out a box and beamed at him through the bars of his cell with a gap-toothed grin. \"It's a harvest scene. I think you'll enjoy it!\" That smile made George break out in goosebumps all over again. Vladimir was sitting on a stool beside his cell. George was too upset to talk to him, or perhaps was just too scared. Though he had only encountered Vladimir once or twice, he had come to be the person George feared most in that awful place, the one who radiated evil like a hot furnace. He had no doubt that it was his sick pet that had come to visit earlier. He didn't know what sick game the king was playing, but he had begun to\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 153 grow desperate to figure out some way to escape. He only wanted to find out whether he'd actually survive long enough to see Roger again. He'd concluded that Vladimir was either going to use hims for some sick sacrificial ceremony out in the cornfield, or he was going to feed the boy to his lapdog, which was easily the most hideous thing George had ever seen in his scant few years. I guess when you leave Earth, there's a whole new world of possibilities of what you might see, I thought. George stared back at Vladimir through the bars, trying to make his face look tough on the outside, but inwardly he was holding back tears. Vladimir gave George an understanding look, as though he thought he could read the boy's mind. It occurred to him that if his pet snake, or rat, or whatever it was, was capable of invading someone's thoughts, his master would probably possess that talent as well. I got the impression that he just hadn't bothered to use it on me yet. He's sizing you up, trying to wait you out. Don't give in George, don't play his games! \"You're a very willful young fellow, aren't you?\" he asked. George said nothing. \"I assure you I'm not playing any games, my young friend. The fact is we're going to have some new visitors arriving shortly, and I thought it'd be... beneficial for you all to get to know each other. In fact I believe two of them are children who should be just about your age. You'll get along famously, I'm sure. In time, you'll probably come to regard them as your own brother and sister. \"You needn't worry. Your brother, I'm sad to say, remains unaccounted for. Something tells me he will be joining us soon, however,\" he added with a wry tone. \"He's got to show up eventually, otherwise what kind of a brother would he be?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 154 \"Don't talk about him,\" he muttered. He hadn't really meant to say that out loud, but it  didn'. \"We don't belong here. When he comes to get me you'll have to let us go.\" \"But why should I let you go, when you'll both be so much happier here? You'll be together and he'll always be there for you. And what's there to miss back home? Your father? He's already forgotten about you.\" He broke into a strange sort of grin. \"He never loved you anyway, he couldn't move on from your mother's death. Admit it, you'll be better off to him gone.\" He couldn't hold back any longer, and a few tears slid down his cheek. \"There, there my boy, don't be upset. Things are going to get one hundred percent better. With Roger here, what's the problem? I'll see to it that you have everything you need.\" At that moment, George felt a slight change in him. \"If Roger and I can be together... then maybe,\" he managed to stammer. \"Maybe that would be all right.\" Vladimir's face spread into a grin that only enhanced his wolfish appearance. That \"click\" that had taken place in his mind a moment earlier gave George a weird illusion of being at ease, but his skin still crawled when he saw that smile. \"I can tell you're already beginning to come around! You're a smart lad Georgie, there's talent in your eyes, a bit of fire.\" He got up, dusting off his pants and drawing to his full height, which was not insignificant. As he stroked his beard, seeming to consider something, the hairs pulled down on the wrinkled skin of his face, lending him the appearance of a mummified corpse. \"We have much more to discuss, but don't be frightened - I won't send Henrietta down to bother you again. Not yet, anyway. And one more thing: if your brother does\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 155 show up, just tell him that you both need to wait for me here like good little boys. If he tries to get any smart ideas about escaping, which we both know is not the right thing to do, you'll stop him, won't you? If you can't do it yourself, we might need to call for some help. Henrietta can be very territorial, and should she deem him a threat... well, you never know what could happen.\" He headed for the staircase at the end of the hall, but turned back before ascending the steps. \"I'm glad we're finally getting to know one another better, George. Everything's going to be all right.\" His steps echoed up the stairs, followed by the clang of the metal door, and the shriek of the bolt as it slid back into place.   # Charon bid the pair farewell with a wave of his bony hand as they stepped off the boat. \"Percy, I've got to tell you, I'm getting a bit tired of these so-called 'challenges',\" Roger said, sounding a bit testier than perhaps he had meant to. \"We almost got killed back there, more than once. I don't know if you noticed while you were hopping around trying to grab the key.\" He felt for it in his pocket to make sure it was still there. \"But the boulder was this close to rolling backwards and crushing me to death.\" \"Now, now, Roger, calm down. Only one hurdle remains, and if what I've heard is true, this last test won't be nearly as risky.\" Roger could only hope he was telling the truth. He trusted him - to an extent - he was the only helpful creature he'd met in the Realm so far, and he'd already made peace with the fact that he couldn't go it alone. He knew the lay of the land, and without him Roger would have been lost.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 156 They inched their way up the sandy embankment until they were standing on a ledge above the river once more. Roger couldn't figure it out; the mighty Styx was moving at its usual steady pace, but the inexorable rise that they had seen upon our arrival had abated so far as I could tell. The violent churning of the rapids had settled to mere swells in the current, and the water level looked about even with where it had been before I had noticed anything happening. Something about our presence was definitely causing a reaction in the river, as if it were a living moat trying to protect some priceless treasure. Roger took the key from his pocket to have a closer look. It appeared incredibly ancient - there was no doubt about that - and the ornate metalwork that formed the handle struck him as something that may not have been made by human hands. It was unlike any craftsmanship he'd ever seen before, and the weight of the object was far greater than he had expected. In fact, it felt heavier in his hand than it had when it was just resting in his pocket a second before. It was as though the key was accumulating some invisible mass with every step they took away from the beach. \"Percy, let's pick up the pace a bit, I think something might be wrong with this key.\"  He put the key back in his pocket, but with every step the weight increased, ounce by ounce until he had to keep one hand on his waistband to prevent his pants from slipping down.  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean it's getting heavier! Come on, we have to move, this thing is going to make me lose my balance.\"  \"Here, let me carry it, birds have impeccable balance, don't you know.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 157  \"Percy, I honestly don't think you could carry it at all right now. Your beak would be dragging along the ground.\"  \"As you say. Keep moving, the door's there, up ahead. Do you see it?\" Roger did. In the gleam of the moisture on the slick stone wall he could make out the outlines of thick oaken paneling, ghostly and luminescent in the gloom of the cavern. The roar of the river filled their ears, and it felt as though all the moisture had gone out of Roger's tongue. Worse, he was starting to get dizzy. \"Roger, are you keeping your shield up? I get the impression those things don't want us to leave,\" Percy said. His voice sounded very distant. He turned around to face the ledges on the opposite shore, where of course the observers were standing, staring, and sending out thoughts that made Roger start to feel certain urges - ones that made him want to do harm to Percy ... or himself. \"I... I don't feel well, Percy, I think I'm going to sit down.\" \"No no no, don't do that! Roger, wake up, sing that song in your head again. The one with the strange melody.\" (get your motor runnin'...) He couldn't focus. There was just no way that he could stand up to the kind of voltage the robed figures were putting out, not after all he'd just been through. After all you've just gone through, exactly. You're not going to let those deatheaters ruin your chance of saving Georgie. Not on my watch, brother, he's yours, and you are going to make it to that door. Come on, you know the words: Lookin' for adventure / in whatever comes our way... You've got to do it, Roger, right... NOW! He gave his head a hard shake and felt the fog in his mind dissipate. He concentrated on the lyrics - I had sung them in my head and out loud countless times\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 158 over months and months of listening to my Dad's records, but I never thought that they'd play such an important role . I repeated the lines over and over in my head until the words began to sound like an alien language. \"That's it, Roger, pull yourself together, we're almost there!\" Percy's voice cut through what little remained of the trance they had put him in - a bit of a sneak attack, and not very sportsmanlike, he thought - and they hustled the last hundred feet to the door, Roger's sneakers squeaking on the treacherous surface as he fought to keep his balance. The force of the key pulling him down grew stronger with every step, and it was all he could do not to go tumbling over the edge, certain to shatter his skull on a jagged outcrop before plunging into the icy black waters below. When they were close enough to stand immediately in front of the door, Roger could see the keyhole located just below the handle, which did not protrude, and appeared to be completely two-dimensional, just like the rest of the door. \"Are you sure this is going to work?\" \"We passed the challenge didn't we?\" \"It isn't over yet.\" Roger took a deep breath. \"Here goes nothing.\" He pushed the key into the lock, where it sank into place with a reassuring clunk. He said a brief and mostly subconscious prayer, then gave it a twist. Some clanky internal mechanism ground into motion, and the frame of the door rumbled out of view, revealing a black space that was somehow terrifying in its pure emptiness. He felt the sides of the opening and wasn't surprised to find zero flaws or indications that the huge panel had slid out of view before their very eyes. \"Do you really think it's safe, Percy?\" Fear had crept back into Roger's voice, and his nerves were acting up in a hurry.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 159 \"All we have is faith, Roger. Everything's going to be all right.\" Without another word, they stepped into the darkness.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 160               CHAPTER 16  Mother Florence regained consciousness some time later, awakened by the jostling of the horses. Her mind instantly flashed to the children, but her hands were bound and she couldn't move her head. All she could see was the stony ground passing by a few feet from her face, and there was no way for her to catch a glimpse of Maisie or Hector. She could sense that they were nearby, however. And that they were alive. Florence was aware of the fact that they had been kidnapped by Vladimir's Rangers. The story she told the children had been true all along of course, and if his pet thing - what did he call it? Henrietta? - hadn't chased her away from that house all those years ago, it would have been these men to do his bidding and harbor that secret. But what did he do with the children? she thought. Maybe there was enough evidence (in her mind) to prove that he was the force behind all those disappearances, but there had to be more layers to the plot. She hardly knew anything - nor had she really ever rationalized what she saw in that room behind the bookcase. A child's room? Bloody clothing? True, she had no idea whether it was really blood, but what else could it have\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 161 been? What about the mobile spinning over the crib? Do you remember what that was made of? She closed her eyes and was somehow gladdened by what she heard, despite what she knew about the owners of those voices. \"Won't be long now. See that glow just over the next ridge?\" \"Vladimir's estate?\" \"Yes sir. Kept the lights on late, as promised.\" \"Been a long day's ride.\" \"Yeah, s'pose he might have something cooked up and waiting for us when we get in. That'd be fine.\" The horses trod on, clip-clop, clip-clop. \"Think he'd do that?\" \"Yeah, that Mandrake is actually one hell of a chef, come to mention it.\" \"Heard he cooks up some other things.\" \"Yeah, heard that one too.\" \"Think that'll happen to this lot?\" Martin shrugged. \"Part of me could feel bad, y'know, but then hell, the money! I ain't never seen so much gold as that last payday.\" \"There's more to life than gold, Martin.\" \"Mebbe so. I haven't it found it yet though, m'self.\" They rode on. The lights from Vladimir's estate created a hemisphere that raised the darkness up from a glowing center. Luther cocked his head and wondered if he could hear drums beating faintly in the distance. He shook off the impression and urged his horse to move a little faster. Martin picked up on the cue and accelerated to a trot,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 162 closing the distance between them and their destination ever more. Florence couldn't tell whether she was awake or dreaming. She closed her eyes, and prayed that they wouldn't hurt her babies.  # Silty light hit Roger's eyes as he slowly became acclimated to the new room in which he and Percy now found themselves. His eyes had grown so accustomed to the almost-impenetrable gloom of Charon's lair that he had to blink rapidly against the brightness. As his vision adjusted, he realized he was standing in a small library. Book-filled shelves lined the walls from floor to ceiling, and a fire crackled merrily in the hearth on the far wall. Facing the fire - and hiding its occupant - was a high-backed chair upholstered in red leather with brass buttons all along the sides. The room smelled of leather and soot. \"Percy, where are we?\" Roger whispered. \"Keep your voice down,\" he replied. \"We're standing in the presence of a very great man.\" A greeting boomed out from the front of the chair: \"You may approach.\" His voice had a grit to it that was somewhere between Clint Eastwood and Louie Armstrong. Casting a nervous glance at Percy, Roger stepped forward to get a look at the occupant of the chair. The shock he'd felt at seeing the giant mole in the first boxcar, followed by the encounter with Charon, had slightly diminished his capacity for surprise, but he still gave a start when he first gazed upon the thing in the chair. Strange barnacle-like ruptures transformed the waxy skin of what might have passed for an otherwise-normal face in a cascading pattern all down one side. A huge welt on his forehead gave off an oily gleam in the firelight, just below where a few wispy\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 163 strands of hair drooped down. Roger's eyes wandered lower, and he saw sinewy grey tentacles slung over the front of the chair where a normal person's legs should have been. Several more ropy appendages extended from his shirtsleeves. He used one of these to light a pipe with surprising dexterity, and puffed greedily at the smoke that issued from the stem. He wore a ragged shirt that looked like something Roger remembered his mom wearing to bed in the wintertime. Roger had to stifle a shudder as the creature exhaled rich-smelling smoke, which bloomed and dispersed as it met the heat coming from the fireplace.      \"Percy! How nice to see you. I see you've brought me a guest! Strange species. Human, I take it?\"      \"Nick, I'd like you to meet Roger. He's not from around here. We've been traveling together as of late, and we both have very important business to attend to, so if you don't mind...\"      \"Roger, is it? Well, pleased to meet you. I hope you've been having a pleasant stay in this land of ours.\" Roger wasn't sure whether he should extend his hand or not, and said: \"Er ... pleased to meet you, sir. We were hoping you could let us through to see the conductor. I need to get my brother back, you see, and...\" \"If there's one thing I really savor these days,\" the thing broke in, smacking its lips, \"it's a good game of chess. Do you play, young man?\" Roger had played in a few tournaments at summer camp in years past, and still occasionally played his dad when he felt confident enough to win, but he hadn't practiced in ages. Plus, he didn't exactly fancy the idea of sitting across a chessboard from this ghoulish sea creature sitting in front of him.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 164 The experience he'd just gone through in the Underworld had left Roger wanting to keep my mental playing cards as close to the chest as possible. One could never be too sure who was listening out here in the Realm. [Good attitude, son.] Percy's voice came in like a well-tuned AM radio station. I guessed that owing to the fact that we were getting to know each other better, Percy was able to tap into my thoughts all the more speedily. If familiarity formed a key part of the recipe, Nick probably didn't have a clue what we were thinking. But maybe he did. I had learned how to tell when my thoughts were being invaded, at least to some degree; voices clawing for purchase, just like when we were down by the River Styx... but I wasn't picking up anything from the creature in the chair, at least not yet. I suddenly remembered that he had asked me a question. \"Well, I'm not that great, but I know how to play.\" \"A modest lad! That's what I like. You didn't think I'd just let you pass through and see the conductor for free, did you? I am the final challenge, after all.\" He said this with a trumped up air of dignity. \"That's all? If I win you'll let us pass through?\" \"Sure, but before we get started, let me inform you of some rules. Are you ready?\" Here we go, he thought. \"For every move, I'm going to ask you a riddle.\"      I gulped. \"A riddle?\"      \"Yes. Now set up the pieces, I haven't got all day.\"      He slid a low endtable out in front of the chair and plucked a board and a bag of pieces out from underneath using his grease-slicked tentacles. Something squelched beneath the fabric of his threadbare plaid shirt as he moved.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 165      \"Percy, this is nuts, who is this guy?\" I didn't care if I was being rude. This was too much.      \"Roger, where are your manners?!\" he asked in dismay. He turned abruptly to Nick. \"Please don't mind the boy, he's got a bit of a peasant's tongue. If we could just get the game underway, I'm sure we'll be out of your... er, hair... in no time at all.\" Surprisingly, Nick brushed it off with the wave of one appendage.      \"They take their time, but I've heard most of your garden variety interdimensional human children metamorphisize into respectful adults, long as their fragile lives aren't snuffed out too quick, that is.\" He fixed one beady eye on me, as black as a shark's. \"Will you set up the board?\"      I was the first to admit I didn't have a choice, but I didn't see what good manners had to do with it. I just wanted to beat him and never have to look at him again. The face was hideous, and I actually could make out a few of the smaller barnacle-like lumps on his face weeping a pale yellow liquid. Not for the first time, I had to suppress a gag reflex that threatened to ambush me and ruin my now long-forgotten breakfast. Anxiety and mental exhaustion were writ large on my face, and I knew Percy was praying I could only hold on a little longer.   [We're so close son, and he's really not that good of a player. It's the riddles that are tough. I know you can defeat him. Dealing with his looks are half the battle, anyway.]      His black shark's eyes (or maybe they're more like a doll's) snapped to my friend.      \"Did you just... say something?\" Nick asked thinly.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 166      \"Me? Nope. Not a word. Sorry!\" Percy stammered. He closed his beak and looked like he'd be taking a break from talking - or thinking risky thoughts - at least for a little while. That was good. I withdrew several chess pieces from the small drawstring pouch and began placing them on the board: all the pawns first, quick and easy, then you had to make sure each player's back row was perfect, recalling that bishops were more important than knights in the royal hierarchy and therefore securing their role as the left and right-hand men of the king and queen, respectively, if you're white. Queen on her own color, of course, and a black square in the lower left corner completes the picture.      \"All set, sir. Will you be asking me a question before my first move?\"      \"Riddle, my boy, and no, although I won't have long to wait since the ball is in your court. You may begin.\"      Through force of habit, I moved the pawn in front of my king two spaces forward. If I was going to have any chance of winning at all, it would have to be decisive and lightning-quick. The best method for such an attack shared its name with a famous German strategy perfected by Hitler, blitzkrieg, whose Nazi origins always made me feel a little guilty somehow for employing such a strategy myself. At any rate, most self-respecting players can spot it a mile away, and have countless recipes to block it at no strategic cost to themselves - but there are some amateurs out there who still miss it on occasion, either because it's new to them, or they simply forget about it's existence and possibility of use by the opponent until it is just too late. That was always the beauty part for me, as my Dad would have called it. The handful of times that I'd actually mated someone with blitzkrieg, they realized what was going to happen about the second that I laid my hand on the last piece to perform the coup de gras.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 167      \"You know, we had a lad on our sailing ship named Trevor. A good seaman, but I remember he had a bit of an attitude problem, much like the one I detect in you, young man. Oh, he was full of piss and vinegar, always bragging that he'd harpoon the biggest whale in the history of the business, just to make us all look bad. Never did amount to much though, although all men look and sound pretty much the same when they've fallen overboard and a Great White's jaws are clamped around their thigh.\" A twinkle from the fire reflected off his foul eyeballs. \"The thing'd chewed off both his legs at the thigh by the time we got anywhere near 'im. Wasn't a damn thing we could do with a brute that size thrashing around - 18 feet if she was an inch. The beast ate its fill and then just left him there to bob in the water like a bloody cork, 'fore we finally hauled him outta there.\"      I had some difficulty figuring out how to respond, even just in terms of my facial expression. I probably looked like I had just sucked on a lemon.      \"Um ... that sounds rough, sir.\"      \"You don't know the half of it.\" He curled one tentacle around to scratch the back of his misshapen head , then pushed a pawn forward with what seemed like a surprising lack of interest. I could make out the faint trail of slime he'd left behind as he withdrew the appendage. I was starting to think my juvenile plan might have a chance. Just don't touch the knight. Please don't touch the queenside knight.  \"Your move kid.\"      I remembered how I used to watch my grandpa and his friends play poker, trying to pick up on each other's cues and ticks when they would lie or hint at the truth of what fortune their cards contained. Here, I had no idea what kind of emotional perceptiveness my opponent possessed, but I had what felt like a good idea of how much\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 168 - or in this case, how little - he was paying attention to the game. I tried to mimic the brusqueness with which he had shoved his pawn into play, and slid the bishop into striking position on his high right flank. It wasn't hard to appear distracted; I was still thinking with horror upon the little gem of an anecdote he had just told me. I took my hand off the piece, signalling the finality of the move.      \"So you were a ... a whaler?\" I asked, unsure whether I'd used the right word. It was no easy feat to engage him in conversation, but I had to keep his mind off the game.      \"Yes, yes I was...\" He trailed off and studied the board a little too intently for my own comfort. \"Saw a lot of good men die out there, swallowed up by the hungry ocean. Not that I was spared, you understand.\" He raised his eyes to look at me. \"S'pose you think I'm a monster, don't you? Well, can't say I much blame you, I certainly do look a fright.\" He leaned closer. \"Wanna know what happened?\"      I really had no desire to hear what events could have possibly transpired to leave him in such a disfigured state. Anything to keep him distracted. I needed all my focus in order to make sure that his concentration was compromised.  Honesty wasn't always the best policy if you intended on getting what you wanted in life, and right now I wanted to end this chess game and be done with these dratted challenges once and for all. \"Your move,\" I added, with as much nonchalance as I could muster.     He absently pushed the same pawn that he had moved out two spaces one square ahead. I considered reminding him that he had insisted on asking me a riddle after every move, but that would have been like correcting the guy who worked at the comic book store the time he undercharged me for the new Batman. I didn't know what\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 169 he had in mind (I certainly wasn't able to read his thoughts, regardless of whether he could read mine, which I doubted) other than perhaps trying to stage an attack on my bishop. As things stood, my most religious piece was not located in harm's way, and I concealed any reaction or excitement that I might have displayed in some other world where such indicators might not have mattered. He's going to fall right into my trap, I thought. Two more moves and you've got him. He's not even asking you the riddles - looks like the Bilbo and Gollum scenario won't be playing out the way you thought it would. Maybe it's just too many games for him to keep track of.      \"I know what you're thinking,\" he said. It felt like the blood in my veins had suddenly turned to so many quarts of ice water. He knows my plan. The jig is up, as they say in those old detective shows Dad likes to watch. \"And no, I haven't forgotten about the riddles. I got a bit distracted by thinking about the demise of young Trevor, but now I'm going to ask you two in a row.\"      \"That's not fair!\" Percy piped up from beside my chair. I had almost forgotten about him entirely. \"You're changing the rules, Nick. I won't stand for it.\"      \"Calm down Percy, just because this young whippersnapper made a quick move when my concentration was off doesn't mean that your team can change the rules.\"      \"No, that's not fair,\" It felt like a stranger was working my tongue and vocal chords. \"Once you've made your move, that's it. It's not our fault you forgot, but you can still ask me one riddle. Your loss on the first turn.\"      Nick looked puzzled for a moment at this act of rebellion, but after a moment a look that somewhat resembled consent - and maybe even some primitive form of admiration - played across his grotesque features.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 170      \"So be it. But don't think I'll be making such allowances in the future.\"      \"Get on with it Nick. Ask him the riddle.\"      He squirmed  in his armchair. The fabric that I could see when he leaned forward to stare at the board was dark with slime and moisture. I clenched my teeth to suppress a shudder.      Without further comment, he moved out a knight... but to the edge of the board. Does this guy even know what he's doing? I wondered. Might as well just give the piece to me if that's where he's going to put him. I thought every chess player knew that sticking a knight to the wall was as good as paralyzing him, plus it did nothing to hinder my blitzkrieg. If he'd gone the other way, though... that would have been bad news. I kept my eyes on the board and listened to his voice as he revealed the riddle: \"I'm as large as a mountain Though I look small as a pea I float on forever In a waterless sea He grinned. \"What am I?\" I raised my head to look at his crustacean-infested visage and inwardly recoiled as a faint ghost of a smile spread across his mutilated lips.      I concentrated hard. My mind transported me back to a place that I had once been, but could never return to. George and I were lying out on the grass in our backyard late on a summer's night at a time in our lives when we were just starting to appreciate the vastness of the universe.      How big do you think a star actually is, Roger? George had asked me in a voice that was small and querulous. I didn't know, but I told him what I had learned\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 171 from an episode of an old science show on PBS: that they were really just enormous balls of gas, and that they were probably a lot bigger in person than they looked to us down here on Earth. I'd never been that great at astronomy, but I remember thinking of the stars that lit up the night sky above us as massive, impossibly bright beach balls, just floating along in an ocean that didn't have any water...      I snapped back to the present. \"That's easy. The answer is 'stars,'\" I said, now wearing a smirk to match Nick's. In reply, he gave me a look that was somewhere between a scowl and pure hatred.      \"Very well. Let us play on then. You won't get off so easily next time.\"      I was surprised that I'd guessed the answer so quickly, but it was like the Jumble at the bottom of the comics section; sometimes the solution would click the second you looked at it.      As the game stood, I was two moves away from depriving this sea-demon of a victory and erasing the final challenge on this seemingly endless train ride - although, it hadn't occurred to me in several minutes that we might actually still be on the train, as I hadn't felt the rumble of the wheels underneath us since stepping through the door of the very first boxcar. It seemed reasonable to conclude that I might not even be in the Realm at all. How many layers are there to this place? I thought, with a rather dizzying sense of wonder. At that moment, I didn't really care - I was still trying to hold down my modest breakfast in the presence of this bizarre creature. I wondered again if there might not be some harm in having to look at such pure ugliness for an extended period of time, like a slow-acting Gorgon. Although, I reflected, a real Gorgon would be female, so maybe there isn't that much to worry about.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 172 I resumed staring at the board and banished the distracting thoughts from my mind. They would only serve to disconcert and terrify me if I let his ghastly appearance work its way under my skin.      \"Go on, then, I haven't got all day,\" he growled. I mimicked some fretting and second-guessing as I hovered over various pieces on the board; first the knight, then a random pawn as if I meant to build a wall for long-term defense. I couldn't keep the charade on forever, though. My fingers grasped the queen by her dainty crown - the set was beautifully carved out of some alien wood, polished to a fine gloss with ornate detailing that went right down to the facial features of each individual piece - and I dragged her with as little confidence as possible out into the arena. She sat there in the third row, her target standing unawares on the other side of the board. The number of spaces between my assassin and the opponent's king belied any suspicions that an attack might be imminent, but she was poised like a slingshot that must be cocked back a good distance to achieve fatal velocity. One more move, that voice of hope said, one more move and he's toast - as long as he doesn't block it. I realized how sweaty my palms had gotten, and I pressed them into the cloth of my shorts. \"All right, you know the rules, even though you shirked them last time. I'm really gonna stump you, kid.\" He paused to formulate the riddle, his eyes growing deep and pensive. \"So, here it is: The poor have me, The rich need me. I am greater than the power of Vladimir Cruor And more devastating than the Famine...\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 173 ...What am I?\" He finished the riddle and gazed at me with a misty stare that clouded his soulless shark eyes, which had managed to look so human only a moment before. I was bewildered. \"More evil than the Famine?\" I repeated. \"Naturally, more evil than the Famine,\" he uttered, doing little to alleviate my confusion. \"She's the most evil force this land has ever seen. Vladimir visits her upon the Realm at times of great upheaval. Sets everybody back in their rightful place, you see. Hungry people start to think a lot more clearly on questions like, 'who's in charge around here,' and 'wouldn't we rather obey than suffer through this?' People sort their priorities out pretty quickly when the Famine comes to town. Deep down, Vladimir doesn't consider her to be all that evil... oh, but the townsfolk do.\" [Just give him a little more rope and he'll hang himself,] Percy broadcast into my head, [he's on the verge of giving away the answer! Think hard - the answer's stuck on the tip of my tongue, but I know you can get it!] Nick fidgeted self-consciously, as if he knew he had already said too much. I racked my brain for any past experiences that might shed light on the puzzle, but could find only... nothing. The word itself, NOTHING, blooming in bright neon letters out of the black abyss of my mind. A woman's voice, saying nada over and over again until the end of time. Another voice in my head began to speak, though this one I did not recognize: There is nothing more devastating than the Famine. In the Realm, to the townsfolk, the theory seemed to hold true, especially given all that Nick had just told me.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 174 The poor have... nothing. The rich need nothing. True enough anywhere, I suppose. I guess it must be one of those 'facts of life' that Dad's always going on about. And finally: There is nothing greater than Vladimir Cruor's power. Could that really be the answer? As I checked it against Nick's criteria, it dawned on me that it was. Nothing was greater than the de facto emperor of the Realm - a fact that will have to be reckoned with in time, that same unfamiliar voice proclaimed from the back of my head. Don't forget, he's the one who's holding Georgie hostage at this very moment. I hadn't forgotten, but there was business at hand to be taken care of. My lips moved soundlessly, and I found that I had lost my voice for a moment. I meant to say \"nothing,\" but nothing would come. I cleared my throat and tried again. \"The answer is 'nothing.'\" Percy uttered a small, involuntary squawk that must have been somewhere between triumph and surprise. I'd guessed right yet again. Nick drummed his fingers, which were really just smaller tentacles protruding from the end of his ropy and sinuous arm - or rather, arm-like growth - and gave me a look that could peel the paint off a schooner's hull. \"So it is, so it is... You've played well, boy, but I think your luck is about to run out. You can't possibly hope to guess any of the others I've got in store.\" He sounded smug, but there was a strange noise coming from the back of his throat, as if he were gargling seawater.  The game was over and he still had no idea. I felt that old confidence seep in. There's no way he'll make the right move to block my plan now. His other tentacle\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 175 switched lazily through the air as he made to select a piece. He moved out a pawn... which had been standing in front of his right-hand rook, and could not possibly have mattered less.  The second he lifted his hand from the ebony-colored henchman, I pushed my queen several spaces across the board, decapitating (in my mind's eye) the pawn that guarded his king with one swift stroke. All others who might come to their majesty's assistance were hopeless blocked. \"Checkmate,\" I declared, using the base of my queen to knock his pawn over, which rolled to one side like the headless corpse that it was. His king had nowhere to run. The bishop covered the queen like a rebel fighter holding a Kalashnikov, ready to rain down deadly suppressing fire should his comrade fall under attack. The sudden defeat had apparently rendered Nick speechless. He wasn't shaking with rage - but appeared to be on the verge of doing so. One of the bubbles on his face actually ruptured, sending a rivulet of amber-looking fluid on a sticky course down his misshapen cheek.  \"This can't be,\" he murmured. \"I haven't lost in twenty-five years.\" \"I'm afraid that's just what's taken place,\" Percy said, standing by my side. I focused on quelling the nausea that had had hit me after seeing his blister explode. Despite my best efforts, I could feel hot nausea brewing down below, followed by an acidic taste hitting the back of my throat. \"Percy, let's get out of here, I'm not feeling so hot,\" I said in a pitiful voice. \"He's right, Nick, give us the keys, we have pressing matters to attend to. We have to get to Mother Florence!\" He was beginning to sound a bit panicked, as if this creature might not let us go after all. To my surprise, however, he withdrew a large ring of keys,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 176 selecting one almost without hesitation and unlocking the loop to slide it off. This he handed to me.  \"To the victor go the spoils,\" he said. Again, that salty gurgling noise. My skin was crawling. [It's time to go.] The key felt damp, and yet another wave of revulsion swept over me to accompany the steadily creeping nausea. I was sure I'd vomit, but almost as quickly as it had come, the black feeling of despair and disgust passed, despite the fact that I was still clutching the old iron key. The handle was a flat skull that had been welded onto the barrel. I swallowed hard. \"That's it then? We can go?\" I asked. \"I honor my agreements, even if my opponents can't always say the same. That was a low trick you played, skipping the first riddle. Don't think I'll make exceptions should you ever pass this way again. Now get out of my sight before I lose my temper. Take it from Percy - I can be an extremely sore loser.\" Percy nodded appreciatively. Nick turned away from us towards the fire and sulkily began to pack another pipe. It was an immense relief not to gaze at him any longer.  Behind us, a door that I had failed to notice before awaited. Perhaps it had materialized upon my ending the chess match - I couldn't say for sure. I got up from my stool and strode over, ready to bury this episode firmly in the past, and stuck the key in below the carved doorknob. It emitted a loud crunch as the key turned and the tumblers did their work. The door swung open; as with the others, there lay only darkness ahead. Percy and I marched through the opening to confront our fate.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 177 # Daniel, Cassius, and Isaac bustled about as they made their preparations to get underway. There was a military-like efficiency to their movements. They hitched up the wagon and busily laid implements upon the flatbed in back: most important were the scythes, whose long blades gleamed dully in the moonlight. Dusk had fallen but a quarter of an hour ago, but already the moon was making its presence known (not to mention felt. They also loaded rope, and some hatchets for good measure, since one could never quite tell what to expect when crossing the endless prairie at such an hour. Daniel locked the front door of the farmhouse with a huge key. The farmers saddled up and prepared to depart. Cassius sat in front, holding the reigns in his massive fists, which were sheathed in leather gloves. He gave the leather straps a leisurely snap. The two huge steeds in front stamped and snorted before lurching forward. They were underway.      A lamp left on in one of the second-story windows to discourage any intruders glows warmly behind them, and each wonders if he'll live to see that light again. Or... If we should die, will that lamp burn out like a life, with no one to return and replenish the fuel?  They know the danger inherent to their chosen mission, and each man makes his own preparations to face the great beyond in pursuit of their cause.  The familiar rumbling of the wagon wheels beneath the three sturdy figures is the only sound for a time; then, somewhere in the distance, the wolves begin to howl.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 178\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 179               CHAPTER 17  \"Hey, Georgie-boy! I've brought some new guests to keep you company!\" Vladimir's unmistakable voice echoed down from the top of the stairs, and although George been swimming in a fog of despair, he snapped out of it at once. The sound of shuffling boots came after this proclamation - multiple men, and judging from their unsteady footfalls, they were carrying something heavy. He got up from his cot and strode over to the bars of the cell, wrapping his hands around the cold vertical bars as he peered down the hall. Vladimir was standing off to one side, and two rough-looking men were dragging along the bodies of a woman and two children. A little boy and a girl, to be exact. George felt his chest seize up as his mind flickered toward panic. Stars danced before his eyes as if he had just been dealt a harsh blow to the head and suddenly he felt very dizzy. Please don't let them be dead, he thought, but to his amazement and relief, the little girl they'd brought began to stir. She seemed to realize where she was all at once; new fear dawned in her eyes, slicing through the slow return to consciousness like a knife. She looked at her mother, who had already lost one brown shoe as the pale\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 180 cowboy hauled her unceremoniously by one arm, and began to bawl. The tears came hot and fast, and soon the boy that George assumed was her brother woke, and joined her in wailing. He beat his tiny fists against the rider's shoulder, who appeared not to even notice. Under the sounds of their grief George could hear the clink of his spurs on the stone floor. The burly pair did not speak. Vladimir called out to George again from the end of the hall; he had to raise his voice to be heard over the wails of anguish. \"You think you can teach these two some manners, George? They seem awful upset. I need you to show them that this is a nice place to live.\" He leered at the boy, his face illuminated by the torchlight. The cowboys - or whatever they were - finally reached the end of the corridor, and without any further ado dumped the three new prisoners in a waiting cell. The older woman slumped onto the cot like a sack of potatoes. The first man - they looked so much alike that George could barely tell them apart - slammed the door and locked it with a steely clatter. The bolt shuddered into place with a cold finality. The little boy ran to the bars of his own cell, with the hard fact of his own imprisonment now dawning on him. He stood directly across from where George was now positioned across the hall. \"Please, let me out!\" he sobbed as the gruff riders marched off in silence. Throughout the whole incident, which lasted only five minutes or so, they had never uttered a single word. \"Thank you men, that'll be all for now. If you'll wait for me in the dining hall, Mandrake will see to it that a hot meal is prepared for you.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 181 They touched the brim of their hats in acknowledgement as they passed and continued on their way up the stairs. Vladimir came down the corridor with a quick, graceful gait that almost made it look as though he were floating. \"Now then, I must politely insist that you pipe down, young man. You'll disturb your new playmate. George, meet Hector...\" Vladimir turned to the little girl, \"...and you must be Maisie! I've heard so much about you. Your mother and I used to be good friends, you know.\" \"I'm sure you'll be excited to know that it won't be long until we're able to move you to your new quarters, which I have no doubt you'll find far more comfortable and attractive.\" George was still too terrified to speak. There was nothing he could say or do that would improve the situation, it seemed. Three more people had been taken hostage by the evil king, and he remained powerless to escape. All he could do was wait... wait, and hope for Roger to arrive. Hector continued his tirade of angry sobs, shaking the bars in frustration, looking like a miniature version of a captive King Kong. George might have been able to say something to ease his mind, but with Vladimir still in the room, he was unable to find his voice. The king stood there and continued to leer at his newest captives. \"Settle down, son, or I'll have to send Henrietta down here to teach you some manners. She can be very unpleasant when confronted with ill-behaved children,\" he said in a voice that bristled with irritation. \"No ... not her,\" George uttered in a voice that was closer to a moan of fear.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 182 \"Well, well, well! Little Georgie has something to say!\" He turned towards him. \"It's fine. She won't come unless I decide there's a good reason, so for now you have nothing to worry about. All will become clear soon enough, at any rate. You won't need to worry about such trifles for much longer.\" George knew that any chance he and Roger might have of escaping and making our way home would soon vanish into thin air. # What greeted Roger and Percy as they eased their way through the black portal was nothing more than the engine room of the train, exactly as Roger had always imagined it when the authors of the various Westerns he read used to describe them. Shoveling coal with his back turned was a man in blue overalls and a striped cap. The conductor, he presumed. The landscape outside rushed by as though they'd never left the train, awash in pale blue moonlight. In the distance, a couple of wolves bounded by, their heads turning sideways to glance at the train from time to time to match its speed. Their tongues flapped in the wind like red flags. \"'Spect you'll be wantin' to stop and see Missus Florence then,\" the man said without turning. Percy took a cautious step forward to address him. \"Yes sir, if it wouldn't be too much trouble.\" \"No trouble 'tall. You made it through the challenges, so I guess I'm under contract to drop you off wherever you specify. I was sorry 'bout what happened to Elizabeth though.\" He finally turned around - to stare directly at me. \"You felt the need to lash out with that blade, boy?\" he asked. Roger realized he was talking about the mole-like monster in the first car.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 183 \"Well, sir, she was about to devour us. I did what I had to do.\" The conductor went back to stoking the furnace. \"Aye, that y'did. Can't say I blame ye - she always did have a bit of a temper. I'm sure she'll be all right in time - just a little wounded pride, that's all. You did well to get by.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"We'll be making our final approach in about ten minutes. You can make y'selves comfortable by the fire, if y'like.\" Roger hadn't noticed, but two wooden chairs were positioned neatly off to one side. The traveling companions sidled over and did as the conductor suggested. It felt wonderful to catch their breath and take a load off. The coal-burning stove finally eased the chill out of their bones that had set in while they'd been galavanting around the Underworld, and the chairs were by far the most comfortable thing Roger had had to sit on since arriving in the Realm. He suddenly realized how poorly he smelled; his body emitted a pungent mixture of sweat, and something that he had picked up in the Underworld that he thought might be sulphur. The odor could have been bottled and sold as a gag gift under the label \"Old Warm Egg.\" \"I should tell mention that I can't be held responsible for anything that might happen to you out on the plains,\" the conductor said in a low voice. The flames flickered hypnotically as he hurled another shovelful of coal into the stove. The engine belched thickets of smoke into the air above the train as they rolled on through the night.  #\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 184 \"Well, this is us.\" Roger had already begun to doze off when he suddenly felt the train slowing down by degrees. Percy was preening the feathers on his good wing and appeared lost in thought when he noticed it as well. They both turned their heads to look over the sidewall of the engineer's booth. To Roger's surprise, there was a rickety wooden platform beside the track, which formed a kind of primitive station. An old sign hung from a rusty nail between two poles rising from the center, which read \"DEATHWATER FLATS.\" The smears of red paint that formed the letters gave off the distinct impression that perhaps a mentally unsound person had drawn the sign in blood. Roger had yet to see an actual body of water in the Realm, though several craters I had spotted during the ride looked like they could have been dried-up ponds.      \"You won't see much water 'round these parts no more, but keep an eye out for abandoned wells and the like,\" the conductor muttered from beneath his cap, as if reading  thoughts.   \"I wouldn't want to wind up here this time o' night, tell ya that much.\" His words had all the encouraging effect of a bad omen. \"Please watch your arms and legs as you exit the vehicle, and good luck out there.\" He reached over and unlatched the low door that was built into the side of the cab, which swung outward into the night on a leather hinge. Roger stepped out onto the platform, with Percy right behind. Eyeing a couple of dust devils that had formed off the tracks to the west with suspicion, Roger remembered the mini-twister that had scooped him up and deposited him onto the train what seemed like days ago. A familiar, crawling dread was beginning to worm its way into his stomach as he realized he had absolutely\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 185 no idea what to expect out here. The conductor's warnings had not been very subtle, after all. \"Percy, we should really get moving,\" he said, hoping to sound more confident than he felt. Someone had to start filling the leadership role a little more frequently around here, and it looked less and less like Percy was going to be up to the challenge.  He remembered with regret the feelings of anger he had experienced on the banks of the River Styx, when those demented things tried to invade his thoughts. It won't do any good to get mad at Percy - he's gotten you this far, and look at what a good guide he's turned out to be, he thought. Yes, Percy had proved to be a reliable friend, and he should have felt blessed. Instead, impatience and fear continued their inexorable drag towards the center of his head, like a nightcrawler heading for the core of a juicy apple. He tried to shake it off as they prepared to move out. Roger turned to wave a quick farewell to the conductor, but the train had already begun to pick up steam, and all he saw was the back of his striped cap as the iron behemoth lumbered away from the platform. The ground beneath his feet rumbled mildly, but otherwise felt spongy and dead. \"This way, Roger,\" Percy said, and together they trod off in the direction he'd indicated. A little ways off, Roger could just begin to see a cold glimmer of light, which split the horizon like a tiny rising sun. He had heard of mirages before, but didn't think they were possible at night. \"Percy, you see that?\" he whispered excitedly. \"I see it all right, but we have to pick up the pace. Something about this doesn't feel right at all.\" There was a distinct note of fear in his voice, and Roger began to detect\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 186 a hint of what he was talking about. The boy accelerated to a light jog, and Percy stretched his jumps into longer bounds to match his speed. The glow gradually grew clearer to the point where they could see what looked like sheets of fire leaping up, hungrily consuming everything in the vicinity. This was no campfire - someone had set this, fully intending for the conflagration to burn out of control. The site appeared to be completely deserted, but they scanned the area, fervently hoping their eyes wouldn't come across any charred bodies. \"Come on, Roger, this is serious!\" They closed the rest of the distance to the campsite and skidded to a halt just outside the ring of light cast by the flames. What they saw confirmed their worst fears. The campsite lay in utter ruin. Few traces of its original homeliness remained, and the burning object whose glow they'd seen from a distance looked like it had once been a very cozy tent. The poles that had acted as supports shuddered from the heat and finally gave way, sending up a shower of sparks as the rest of the structure collapsed in a heap. Various objects strewn about at their feet told a tragic story of the family that had lived there, up until some unnatural force had torn down everything they held dear. Off to their left, Roger spotted a doll with scorched hair. Not far from it lay a toy pistol that some clever soul had made by lashing together several twigs of different length. \"What are we supposed to do?\" Roger murmured. \"Oh this is terrible, terrible!\" Percy cried. He strutted about, apparently looking for any signs of life amidst the debris. \"We're too late. Vladimir's forces have been here, I'm sure of it. This is his handiwork if I've ever seen it.\" There was genuine anguish in his voice.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 187 \"They must be okay, Percy. He wouldn't actually hurt them, would he?\" \"I'm afraid that's exactly what he might do. Vladimir never did like to tread softly when it came to making an example of someone.\" \"Is there any way we can find his place without her help?\" \"Well, yes, I suppose it's possible... if whoever took them came on horseback, I suppose we could just follow the tracks. I don't suppose I'll ever get my wings back though...\" \"They're still alive, I know it. Er... who exactly was she with?\" \"Her two children, Maisie and Hector. They must be about six or seven now. Twins. If those brutes touched a hair on either one of their heads...\" \"Calm down, it won't do any good to lose our heads.\" Roger broke off to look around. There was a fire pit next to the tent, and beside it an old rocking chair had tipped over onto its side at some point during the fray. Whoever had come here had worked efficiently and without mercy. Perhaps they had at least shown some restraint since they were dealing with women and children, but Roger had little confidence in that possibility. One thing seemed certain, however: the people who had kidnapped Mother Florence and her children meant to take them to only one place, and that was Vladimir Cruor's fortress. Wherever they are right now, I'd bet anything they're with George. He's probably keeping them in the same cell, for all I know, Roger thought. It was weirdly comforting and depressing all at once. George would have some company to help weather the storm, at least, but having them be taken prisoner certainly had only served to make things considerably worse. \"Come on, let's look for tracks,\" Roger said.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 188 Percy nodded in agreement and went to scope out the edges of the compound, keeping his beak low to the ground as he scanned for clues. He kept one wary eye on the fire, although once the tent had finally collapsed, the roaring flames had dwindled to little more than a smoldering bed of coals and roasted canvas. The corner of a pillow stuck out from the wreckage like a snapshot of the shelter and comfort the tent had once provided. It reminded Roger of a news story he had seen once about a plane disaster, where the pictures had shown people's luggage scattered amongst the wreckage, their clothes trailing out of busted zippers like spilled intestines. The area in which they could search for tracks was fairly small, now that the blaze had died down, but they were still able to scrounge up a lead without much difficulty. \"Over here!\" Roger called. \"I've got something.\" Percy hustled over to look. \"Two sets of prints,\" he said, \"and they definitely left on horseback. I'd be willing to bet Vladimir sent those Rangers of his.\" \"Rangers?\" The only Rangers he had ever heard of played hockey in Madison Square Garden. \"Yep. They take care of Vladimir's dirty business when he has, let's say, delicate work to do. He considers them very reliable.\" \"What exactly do they do?\" \"Oh this and that,\" he mused, \"mostly intimidation and small-scale terrorism. Vladimir uses them when he needs to keep folks in line, especially the kind of folks who are apt to get out of hand and start talking about rebellion. The Rangers have been known to abuse their power quite effectively when any of the townspeople start calling\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 189 meetings together, or anything else of that nature. Although I'm not sure you can call it an abuse of power when that's exactly what Vladimir pays them to do.\" \"You're serious? He sends these guys out to crack down on meetings?\" \"You bet. At this point, in the Realm, you'd have to be crazy to try and get any kind of group together. Nobody can speak freely these days, and I mean even in private; the only ones who can have learned to shield their thoughts, the way you were able to in that second boxcar.\" It was high time they got out of there, but in spite of all the destruction around them, it somehow seemed wrong to leave the protective orb of light that the fading embers still gave off. Roger couldn't have known that this was the faltering aura of Mother Florence's protection spell, though the Rangers had trampled down its barriers faster than a speeding mail truck running down a stray cat. The force-field had been conjured with the intention of keeping out stray wildlife (including an occasional prairie wolf who was feeling particularly bold), but it had been no match for the iron hooves of their relentless white horses. The tracks snaked off to the east under the light of the full moon, which allowed the pair to walk beside them without much difficulty. \"With any luck, we should be there in an hour,\" Percy remarked, hopping several feet at a time to keep a brisk pace. Creeping tendrils of anxiety gnawed at Roger, replacing the awful trepidation that had plagued him before finding the ruined campsite \"So it all comes down to this, huh? Springing Georgie from Vladimir's mansion, then getting both of us back home to safety. We don't even have a plan though!\" Roger said \"I'm hoping we'll run into a little more help on the way,\" Percy replied.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 190 \"Oh? What makes you so sure?\" \"The Brothers Grimsrud. They might change their mind and help us. I sensed good in them.\" \"Don't be silly. They're working with Vladimir, just like the Rangers.\" \"Those brothers don't have much to thank Vladimir for these days (not that they ever did), and it wouldn't surprise me if they took this latest kidnapping as a motivator to settle the score.\" \"What do you mean, Percy?\" \"There've been many others like you, Roger. No one knows what happened to them, but their fates probably ended up being quite gruesome. I've heard he feeds them to his giant pet lizard named Henrietta, sometimes.\" \"That can't be true! What giant pet lizard?\" \"Sorry - all I meant to say is, time is running short. I'm afraid he may be planning to deal with Mother Florence and her children in very short order.\" \"Well, if we cut down on the mental chatter, maybe we can run a little faster.\" \"Fair enough.\" Roger did his best to make his legs churn faster, all the time keeping one eye trained on the ground to pick up the prints. Percy did an admirable job of keeping up right beside him, and in his heart he applauded his efforts. \"We'll run into some help all right. No doubt about it,\" Percy said.  # A few miles away and just a bit earlier, the Brothers Grimsrud continued their journey with a full wind in their sails. Their instruments banged a clattery rhythm in the back of\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 191 the wagon. The mansion already loomed distant on the horizon, and they knew their voyage was nearly at a close. Soon they would confront the force that had ruled them their entire lives, the man who held all power in the land they called home, and for whom they have slaved in hopes of earning their daily bread. They meant nothing to him, as yet, but they meant to make their presence known without delay. \"Did you sharpen the scythes this morning, Cassius?\" Daniel asked from his post in the shotgun seat. Cassius, who was busy with the reigns, answered with a brisk nod. Isaac leaned back to check the handle of his beloved scythe, which he had nicknamed \"Chopper,\" noting with pride the unblemished surface of its steel blade. \"Won't be long now, fellas,\" Cassius remarked from the driver's seat. \"We're almost at the ridge, now passing Deathwater Flats.\" In fact, the brothers passed by the location of Mother Florence's campsite not ten minutes before the arrival by train of Roger and Percy, although they were too far away to notice the flames that ravaged the site. The Rangers, in turn had already left a half an hour prior, having done their part in kidnapping the small family. The Grimsruds, of course, had no way of knowing what had gone down just a short distance from their current position, or that Mother Florence and her children had been making their home in Deathwater Flats for the past ten years. They rode on in silence. There was still much work to be done.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 192               CHAPTER 18  George scarcely had time to react before Vladimir abruptly turned and exited up the stairs, leaving the four of them to get to know each other in the confines of the dungeon. By now, Mother Florence had woken up and was sitting upright on the cot, rubbing her head with one hand. The children rushed to her. \"Mama, mama we were so scared, are you all right?!\" they screamed, grasping at her for comfort. \"Hush, children, everything will work out fine, just calm down, there there.\" She turned to face George. \"Greetings, little one, and what might your name be?\" she asked. \"George,\" he answered. It was much easier to talk when Vladimir wasn't around. \"George, yes... I feel like I know you already,\" she said, smiling. \"I've seen your brother in a vision. He was with a talking crow, on a train. He's on his way here, you know.\" He couldn't believe his ears. Roger really is coming to save me!\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 193 \"I knew it!\" he cried, unable to hold back. He rushed to the bars. \"You really saw him?\" \"Yes, I believe I did, young man. He and his friend seemed bent on coming to see me, in fact. Only, that won't exactly be possible now, since we've been forced out of our home.\" She cast a baleful glance in the direction of the stairway, where Vladimir had last been sighted. The creases in her face softened when she returned her gaze to the boy across the corridor. George wasn't sure what she meant. \"Roger wanted to see you?\" he asked. \"He wanted to - the bird had been wronged by Vladimir Cruor, and he had an idea that I'd be able to restore his gift of flight. The truth is I'm not sure I could've done much for him. Your brother, on the other hand, why... I was going to help him infiltrate this very house, to break you out of this dungeon and make it through the portal that's set to open up tonight around midnight.\" George did his best to process this information. \"Portal? You mean like the thing that brought me here?\" \"Yes, just like it. Vladimir had the whole thing arranged well ahead of time, although he meant for Roger to come through first, not you. I believe Vladimir used to kidnap children of the Realm, but they've become rather scarce. I've done my best to protect my own but...\" her voice broke \"I'm afraid he may have finally caught up with us.\" Maisie, who had been clinging to her mother's billowy dress, began to cry. \"There, there sweetheart,\" Mother Florence said, \"I won't let them hurt you. Everything is going to be all right.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 194 \"Mother Florence?\" George said, \"what does he need children for?\" He had a feeling she knew the answer, and the prospect of finding out terrified him. Still, he felt compelled to ask. \"Dear child, if I knew that, we might not've ended up in this mess in the first place, you or my family. The thing is, the people that live here have been in denial for so long that he was the one behind it, that they never confronted him about it. There's a good reason underneath that denial, though: there's almost no limit to the power Vladimir Cruor wields over the Realm. He controls the Harvest, after all.\" \"You mean, he can change the weather?\" She reflected on this. \"I'm not sure... let's just say if he doesn't want anything to grow, then you can be sure nothing will. They had to sacrifice their own children, just so the rest of the families might have something to put on their tables every night. This Realm has been teetering on the brink of famine for a few years now, but everyone is afraid to bear children. They know he'll snatch them up almost as soon as they're born. I was lucky - I happen to possess a few gifts that have allowed my children and I to maintain a low profile and stay out of sight for the most part. Vladimir must have figured out where we were hiding as an unfortunate result of your brother wanting to come see me.\" \"How can that be possible?\" he asked. The wealth of information she was providing made him feel ever so slightly more in control of the situation, which was needed. In fact, it went beyond that; she reminded George a great deal of his mother - what he remembered of her, anyway. \"Your brother cares tremendously about you, and I know that he will do everything in his power to bring you home, safe and sound - wherever it is that you boys\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 195 call home. He also happens to be very resourceful. The train he and the crow were riding can make unscheduled stops for special passengers, but anyone requesting special favors from the conductor must pass a series of tests in order to see their wish fulfilled. Have no illusions - many die when they attempt to pass through that netherworld of the train - but somehow the two of them were able to make it through unharmed. \"Unfortunately, the fact that they successfully managed to divert the train's course, with the intent of getting off and coming to see me for help, led to Vladimir finding out my location by having his men track the train's movements. It was a sad coincidence, I'm afraid, that the Rangers were able to find me before your brother could. While I was able to receive images of your brother, and understand his situation, the Rangers wield a special magic that left me with no warning of their approach - not until it was far too late, anyway.\" \"How did Vladimir know Roger wanted to go see you?\" \"That was the easy part - he knew your brother had taken up with Percy, who'd been waiting years to run into someone he could team up with to pass the challenges. Percy was intent on seeing me for help with his broken wings, and of course Vladimir figured your brother would probably ask me to help him bust you out of here. If Roger had made it just a little before the Rangers, I would have known Vladimir would be looking for me as well, and we'd have been able to escape... such luck was not to be, I'm afraid.\" \"I'm awful sorry that we got you into this mess,\" George said. \"Oh, hush! It isn't your fault, child. Vladimir would've found me sooner or later, anyway. I believe he means to settle an old score with me this very evening.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 196 He didn't know what she was referring to, not exactly, but it sounded serious. Something terrible had happened in the past between Vladimir and this woman. He knew it in his bones, but he had a mind that she wasn't ready to divulge the details just yet. \"All right. Well, what could he possibly want with the children?\" She hugged her children closer and appeared to be on the verge of tears. \"If I knew, I'd tell you.\" She whispered. \"If I were you, I'd start preparing for the end.\"   # Vladimir stood before a wall of whirring machinery, while Henrietta hissed contentedly at his side. Dozens of levers, pulleys, and even a few odd farm implements protruded from where they'd been jerry-rigged to the machine's guts, which held gears that turned and ground away inside. Electrical lights were strung along the top with thin wire, illuminating the scene. No one in the Realm had ever seen electricity, and would probably consider the contraption in Vladimir's basement to be some kind of devilry, or black magic, and in a way they were right. Then again, they had thought of Vladimir as the Devil for a long time now, whether or not they realized it themselves. \"This old thing has gotten us through some hard times, old girl,\" he remarked to Henrietta. She flicked out her tongue in agreement. \"No reason to think she won't see us through again.\" Electrodes encased in glass whirred and hummed with power - the machine occupied an entire wall of the basement room that formed one half of which the dungeon constituted the other - but it was not quite loud enough for George and the\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 197 others to hear, even with the gears inside clattering away. The stones in the foundation prevented any sound from leaking through, which was the way Vladimir liked it. It would not have boded well if any of his prisoners over the years had had some forewarning about what he intended to do with them. (So many children...) Vladimir reflected that, had any of the children known his plans, they might have made more of an effort to escape. And why should these two be any different? Because they had a powerful ally in Mother Florence, that's why. That woman could ruin everything if you didn't make sure to deal with her carefully. \"Don't be foolish,\" another voice pipes up. \"You've run into a tremendous bit of luck, since Roger led the Rangers straight to her family's location, and now that she's under our control, what's left there for us to do?\" \"Kill her?\" \"You could.\" the voice answered; it was cold-blooded and inhuman. Henrietta's tail twirled around Vladimir's ankle. \"The machine is running on fumes you know. What are you going to feed it with, blood from colts and wolf cubs? That won't work forever. You need the children. Even the little girl.\" \"She'll fight us tooth and nail. There might be other complications as well.\" \"You would risk losing your entire kingdom over 'complications'? I think not. Your losing your grip, master. This world will fall into another's hands if you cannot maintain control over the Realm.\" \"Maybe so. Your wisdom has always been a great asset to this kingdom, Henrietta.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 198 \"Thank you, sire.\" \"I think I'll let you have the little boy they call Hector. You've always enjoyed your meals more when they put up a fight.\" Henrietta hissed with delight. \"Your kindness knows no bounds, master.\" Vladimir laughed and smiled at her, grateful for such a worthy companion. The machine continued to sputter and grind.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 199               CHAPTER 19  Pale red lights spread into view just beyond the horizon, and it was clear they were getting close to Vladimir's compound. Percy hopped along, his strength never seeming to wane, and Roger silently saluted him once more for his efforts. He spoke aloud what they already knew: \"Roger, we're almost there. You still have something we can defend ourselves with?\" He patted his pockets and was relieved to discover the knife was still there. \"Well, that's good, but either way we're pretty much done for... unless we manage to infiltrate the house and link up with Mother Florence in time. At this point, she's our only hope.\" \"Why's that?\" \"I think she knows what he's been up to all these years. Something about the source of his power in the Realm - and maybe even a way to stop it.\" \"You think she knows where he gets his power?\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 200 \"I said maybe. I've heard stories though - if he does have some kind of machine stashed away in that house, I'll bet those disappearances have something to do with the way he keeps it running.\" \"What do you mean, Percy?\" Roger's heart thudded dully in his chest as he tried to keep the pace. His legs were growing stiffer by the minute, and a stitch stabbed him painfully in the gut. \"I don't know, my friend, but I can assure you it isn't pleasant. Come on, let's move!\" Roger sucked a few big whoops of air into his lungs. They were making good time - they had no way of knowing how long the journey would take, but it looked like the mansion was no more than a mile away, judging by how long they'd been running. Could Mother Florence really have been camping right on Vladimir's doorstep without him ever knowing? Stranger things had happened, Roger supposed. Maybe the spell really had been enough to keep her family hidden for all that time. A massive structure gradually drew into focus. It appeared to be some kind of gothic monstrosity, with high peaked gables, the tar on the roof black as pitch and complemented by narrow windows with panes of glass that looked to be the color of blood. A dark tower spiraled out from the center of the roof, with a single window lit ominously from within. More lights in the attic below it produced a hideous red glow that had only seemed a harmless pink when viewed from a distance. Jagged iron fencing lined the property, and his eyes scanned the barrier, already searching for a way in. He felt like a commando, risking his life to infiltrate an enemy compound for the sake of some glorious mission. This was it. He tried not to think about the fact that he and George might not make it out of here with their lives.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 201 At last they crested a rise that provided a good vantage point over the immediate area, and Roger crawled up on his belly to survey the field below. \"How do you propose we proceed?\" Percy whispered. As if Roger had any idea. \"I'm not sure - there doesn't look to be any real way through that fence, and I think if we tried to go over we'd end up sticking ourselves.\" \"Looks like the fence isn't the only barrier we'll have to deal with.\" He was talking about the pale red aura that seemed to encircle the place. The source might have been linked to the red light emanating from the attic windows, but Roger couldn't be sure. \"What do you think would happen if we tried to pass through it?\" he asked. \"Are you sure you want to find out? Come on, I think I might know another way in.\" They got off their bellies and crept down the hillside, their footsteps masked by unhealthy-looking patches of grass that sprouted from the dust. They descended the bluff and found ourselves standing not six feet away from the edge of the red shield. \"Let's circle the house,\" Percy said. To Roger's surprise, a wrought-iron gate suddenly drew into focus as they rounded yet another corner. He tried the latch, and found it was unlocked. That was when the furious voices began to flood his mind. \"Roger, remember the barrier!\" Percy shouted, but it was too late. Words and voices that were far more hostile and agitated than the ones he had heard in the Underworld seemed to overrun his head like a raging tide, borne by the electricity firing between the synapses of his brain. Everything swam in a field of red so thick that it threatened to swallow him whole.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 202 Roger cried out to his comrade - then stared helplessly as everything went black. He was dimly aware of his friend hopping about in frantic circles as he screamed for him to get up, for goodness' sake, just please get up, but his consciousness was going the way of his vision. The trap had been as plain to see as the beak on Percy's face, and yet I'd still managed to fall right into it. The sounds and smells, the feel of the dusty ground against his cheek, all faded in rapid succession.  After a few more seconds, he was no longer aware of anything at all.  # Vladimir sat in the dining hall, stroking Henrietta who was at his side. Mandrake stood nearby, watching the fire that he had prepared at Vladimir's behest. The only sound in the room was the roar of the flames. Then, Vladimir's deep voice filled the air. \"Won't be long now, old traveler. The witching hour is at hand,\" he says. \"Yes sir, one hour until midnight.\" \"He'll learn to like it here. Won't matter for long either way.\" \"Certainly not, master. What choice does he have?\" \"I haven't decided which one to keep and which one to feed to Henrietta,\" he said, absently stroking the tip of her nose with one finger. She bent her head and sharpened a single tooth on the left side of her mouth by grinding it along the wooden leg of her master's chair; the process made a rasping noise that was enough to make Mandrake's skin crawl, though he gave no outward sign of irritation. To do so would have been ill-advised. \"I'm sure you'll make the right decision,\" he replied at last.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 203 At that moment, Henrietta stopped what she was doing and flicked her nose in the air, tossing off Vladimir's hand. He gave a start, then watched with curiosity as her tongue darted out; he knew she could smell the air, and had detected possible intruders. \"Can it be, girl?\" he asked, incredulous. \"Mandrake, I believe our period of waiting has come to an end, and not a moment too soon!\" He leapt up, full of vigor, an old man suddenly made young again by the prospect of fresh prey caught in his trap. \"I'll be damned if it isn't that boy and his bird,\" he added. Mandrake shuffled his feet uncertainly, not quite sure what to do. \"Shall I fetch the Rangers, master?\" he asked. \"They've only just retired to their quarters - it could be something slightly more dangerous than a little boy. Who's to say it's them?\" \"No! The Rangers have their instructions. It's the boy, sure as I'm standing here. Grab a knife from the kitchen, and come with me!\" Mandrake had little time to fulfill the order before Vladimir and Henrietta were out of the dining room, making a mad dash for the exit to see what their trap had caught them. Sprinting outside, the two of them looked like a young boy and his beloved dog, gone to look for treasure on a drowsy summer day.  # George heard a commotion from his cell. Chairs scraped and multiple pairs of feet thumped the floor as unknown parties made a hasty exit. Not all of them sounded human, and hot fear began to creep into his belly as his thoughts went back to Vladimir's horrible pet. Henrietta.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 204 \"What was that?\" he asked. Mother Florence's eyes - along with her children's - were glued to the ceiling. \"That didn't sound good,\" she said in a low voice. \"I think someone activated the tripwire aura he's got set up outside.\" Her hand clutched at the fabric of her dress below the neck. \"Aura...?\" \"It's like a burglar alarm, but, well... slightly more aggressive. I've seen it before - a variation on the spell I used to rely on to keep intruders out of our camp. Up until recently, anyway.\" It's Roger! George thought feverishly. He tripped the alarm - but he's come to rescue me!      I wouldn't be so sure of that, said another one of my voices, cynical and older somehow. How well can things possibly be going if he just set off the security system for the entire house? Panic began to creep in as I imagined what Henrietta might do to Roger, if Vladimir perceived him as a threat. \"What happens when someone sets off the alarm?\" he asked, gripping the bars tighter with palms that were damp and clammy. \"Depends on how he's got it wired. Sometimes they deliver a minor jolt, like a brief but horrible nightmare; other times it's worse - there are poison auras that can cause a grown man to pass out and die in a matter of seconds, although some just knock you out cold. Then, whoever set the trap can go see what the cat dragged in...\" \"What kind do you think he's got up there?\" \"I wasn't able to sense much in terms of what Vladimir has set up for the house but... yes, let me see...\" She retreated to the far wall of the cell and laid her hands upon\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 205 the stonework, closing her eyes to sense the invisible vibrations that only she could feel. Maisie and Hector watched her, though their eyes said they had seen her perform similar acts before. \"Good news!\" she said abruptly dropping her hands from the wall. \"I don't think there was anything lethal about the aura. If your brother and his friend are out there, I think we can at least presume they're still alive.\" George breathed a sigh of relief, but the fear refused to dissipate. His stomach felt watery and cramped, and he tried to remember how long it had been since he'd eaten. \"What are they going to do with him?\" \"I'm afraid we'll find out soon enough,\" she answered. \"I think it's safe to say he may be joining us shortly.\" With that, the heavy iron door at the top of the stairs began to creak open.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 206               CHAPTER 20  Roger was dimly aware of fingers fumbling about to get ahold of his body, though his vision remained severely impaired. He felt himself being lifted up, held by the armpits and ankles, and carried briskly off to whatever fate lay in store. \"Looks just like his brother, doesn't he?\" said a familiar voice. [You heard that voice in a dream, Roger.] The thought came unbidden, like any other, but the sound of that mind tapping into his own was unmistakable. [Percy! Where are you? I can't see anything.] [That's all right, son, they're taking us inside. I'm safe - I managed to burrow under your shirt and hide - but we must keep silent. If I'm discovered, then all may as well be lost - it's the last card we have up our sleeve. The hands in his armpits suddenly readjusted, pinching him roughly and causing a cry to escape his lips. \"Mandrake, be careful!\" a voice bellowed from in front of him. \"Sorry, master, I was about to lose my grip.\" \"Never mind, let's just get him inside. We have other business to attend to.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 207 [They can't hear us?] [Not at the moment - speaking telepathically is a gift of mine, and I've chosen to share it with you. Vladimir only has a knack when it comes to reptiles, or if he gets lucky. He relies on other instruments to monitor the world around him. Mother Florence is rumored to possess similar skills - it may allow us to collaborate more effectively once we enter the house. They'll probably take you to the dungeon, but don't be afraid. I'm going to slip out once we're inside and look for the prison key.] [You think that'll work?] [What choice do we have? You were the one who decided to charge helter skelter into the barrier. Not that we would have gotten inside any other way, though...] [I guess you're right. Don't mention it!] [Enough! Vladimir may be an untalented boor and a tyrant, but anyone would be able to tell you're communicating with someone right now if they took a close look.] He could feel Percy's rumpled feathers pressed against the small of his back as he changed positions, still heavily enmeshed in the fabric of Roger's t-shirt; he had done well to hide himself. He may save the day after all, Roger thought. A glimmer of light seemed to be working its way back into his vision, like a sunrise trying to shine through dark curtains. He felt the clomp of heavy boots as the men who carried him ascended several steps. Roger realized his hearing had returned as the tremor of their footsteps became actual noise in his ears. The aura had only meant to knock him out long enough to be taken into custody. A door creaked open at the top of the steps, and the lights grew brighter, as if the doorframe were illuminated by twin torches. Roger forced himself to relax, and tried\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 208 blinking his eyes a few times to wake them up, or something. That's when it finally dawned on him that the man holding his ankles was none other than Vladimir Cruor. Cold fear swept over him like a blanket dipped in ice water, and Roger's legs gave an involuntary spasm. There was something vile in that touch - he had felt it from the moment he picked him up - and he could feel it coming from the other man who held his shoulders as well. What's more, he could sense some other inexplicable presence nearby, one that definitely didn't sound human, judging from the hissing and the scraping patter that could only be made by four legs. When he jerked, the hands that Roger now knew belonged to Vladimir Cruor dug in deeper, and he felt ragged nails pinching skin through his socks, stifling any further movement. He lay still, not wanting to anger him and make his situation worse. \"Looks like we've got a live one here, Mandrake,\" the old man growled. More and more details were starting to filter into the picture Roger could see around him, and it felt like his eyelids were finally coming unglued. \"Aye, master. Might be a good idea to let Henrietta teach him a few manners when she's done with that other brat.\" \"Perhaps, but let's not be too hasty. We still need to find that mangy bird. I know they were traveling together - he must be somewhere on the premises. Now might be a good time to roust Martin and Luther after all.\" He spoke carefully, measuring each word. \"As you wish, master.\" \"Let's get this one downstairs first.\" The pace quickened, and Roger sensed that bruises would form later from how hard their fingers pressed into his flesh. They made a turn to the left, then down a long\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 209 corridor followed by another turn. The sound of a roaring fire greeted his ears, and he could finally make out the outlines of definite objects. There was a table, one of those ridiculously long varieties that looked like it had been hewed out of a single, massive tree trunk. A row of high-backed chairs stood on each side, every single one fit for a king. He recognized the room as a dining hall, and the warmth of the fire provided him with a momentary feeling of comfort. They paused for a break, so far as he could tell, and at that moment, Percy's body, which had up until then been enmeshed in the fabric of his shirt, suddenly rolled loose and dropped soundlessly to the floor below. With that, Percy was gone. [Off to look for the key, I hope?] [I won't let you down, not if I have any say in the matter. We've made it this far together, and we'll see it through to the end.] The men carrying Roger proceeded onward, stopping only once so Vladimir could unlock an iron door with a huge ring of keys that he withdrew from his pocket. The key jangled in the lock as he worked the massive bolt, and the door itself finally slid open on creaking hinges. It reminded Roger of the entrance to a Tower of London exhibit that he had seen once with his parents on vacation. The rivets on the door popped out in all-too-vivid detail as they passed, moving downstairs again, and made it clear that his vision had more or less returned to normal. The air temperature seemed to drop a degree or two with each step they took forward. Roger could barely move his head, but Vlad's broad back stood out before his eyes in sharp relief, framed by the denim straps of the overalls he wore. Behind him, the servant they called Mandrake cleared his throat, hawked, then blew a gargantuan wad of phlegm against the cell wall with a resounding splat.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 210 This must be the dungeon. \"Roger?! Is that you?\" George's voice was unmistakable. His desperate cry cut through whatever remained of the fog the trap had put him in, and he thrashed out, entering what he liked to think of as \"wildcat mode.\" It was enough to take Vladimir and Mandrake by surprise, and they promptly let go of the struggling boy. His feet hit the stone floor, and all he could do was stand there for a moment, too shocked to move. A beat later, and he was off like a shot toward the blurry lights at the bottom of the stairs. \"George!\" Roger cried. \"Roger!\" His voice responded with equal parts delight and fear. \"You've got to get me out of here!\" At the end of the cell-lined hallway, he could see a tiny pair of hands wrapped around the bars of the cell to the right. It must be him, and he's with Mother Florence! Roger thought excitedly. He skidded to a halt in front of the cell that he believed to contain his little brother. What met him instead was a thing with wooden features; a mannequin with doll's eyes that bore no resemblance to the George he knew and loved. There was some demented creature in the cell where George should have been. Black eyes were sewn onto what looked like a canvas head stuffed with straw. A mouth gaped open to reveal a tongue that looked like it had been snipped from a bright red piece of felt. Roger's own tongue caught in his throat, and no words would come. He could only stare at the grotesque imitation of his brother, no more than a cruel mockup created to deceive him.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 211 Roger turned to look at the men who had brought him here. Vladimir Cruor and his Mandrake stood side by side at the end of the hall, each wearing a faint grin, their brawny arms crossed. They reeked of smug satisfaction. \"What have you done with him?\" he shouted. \"You assholes, where is he?\" \"Your brother has been moved to a safer place,\" Vladimir said in a soft voice. \"In the meantime, Mandrake has fashioned a very fine replacement to keep you company. I thought it'd be nice to put you two in the same cell. Mandrake, would you be so kind as to admit the young man to his quarters?\" \"With pleasure, sir,\" he murmured. Roger got into a ready stance like he might make a break for it, but Mandrake spread his arms to strike an imposing figure, his impressive wingspan blocking the corridor in a way that eliminated all chance of escape from his mind. \"I wouldn't try it, bucko,\" Vladimir said. Mandrake blocked him from Roger's view, and he steadily bore down on the boy with outstretched arms, as though he meant to take him in a warm embrace. \"That door at the top of the steps is four inches of reinforced iron, and Mandrake here isn't as slow as you might think. Why don't you just go quietly in... to be with your brother.\" His grin widened into a weird smile. A psychopath's smile, Roger thought. How many other boys have been \"replaced\" by the same freakish doll? And where the hell have they taken George? His stomach took a downward lurch, and he swallowed hard to control his gag reflex. His mind swarmed with the guilt and fear of knowing he'd come too late. He had failed him. \"Where is he?\" Roger cried, now on the verge of tears. \"Just let me see him, I don't care what you're going to do to us, I just want to see him one last time.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 212 Vladimir's gaze dropped to the floor. \"I'm afraid that's impossible, son. He's in rehabilitation already, getting ready to be part of the great machine that runs this Realm.\" \"Machine?\" Roger asked. \"What are you talking about?\" \"What do you think is the biggest factor in determining the success of a harvest?\" he asked with a leer. \"The weather! And who controls the weather?\" \"You?\" \"That's right, my boy! It's a glorious machine - I'm afraid it'd take hours to explain the exact physics of the thing, but by using currents in the air, and feeding it a very special type of fuel, I can influence the outcome of events in the Realm just by using my mind.\" \"You're insane,\" he managed to utter. \"Afraid I'm not familiar with the term. Must be something they only say back where you come from, which is... I'm not sure where, but I'm certainly glad I found you boys! Two for the price of one, wouldn't you say? An exceptionally lucky discovery.\" \"Tell me how to get home.\" He gave a low chuckle. \"I'm afraid it's far too late for that. The exit portal opens only for a few minutes at midnight, and with you both in my care, there wouldn't be any sense in entertaining such foolish fantasies, now would there?\" He laughed again, a single bark that made Roger shudder. \"Besides, you will be with your brother again quite soon, and I do think you two will learn to like it here.\" There was no doubt in his voice; only cold determination that left him feeling like his best friend had just died. He couldn't see any way out of this, not when he didn't even know where George was, unless Percy somehow managed to work a miracle.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 213 \"I'm afraid we'll have to continue this conversation some other time, young master Roger,\" he said. \"Mandrake, please put him in the cell.\" \"Don't come near me. I'll go, but keep your hands off.\" The words came out sounding almost as fierce as he wanted them to. Mandrake also seemed to take note. \"As you wish.\" He moved quickly to unlock the cell door, and the hideous button-eyed thing stepped back. Tears welled up, blurring his vision as he looked upon the mannequin with horror. It's now or never, he thought. As Mandrake continued to fumble with the key, Roger sidled up alongside him. In one smooth motion, he elbowed him in the hip with all his strength.  Mandrake screamed and doubled over in pain. Roger turned and sprinted past Vladimir Cruor, who could only stare at the boy in numb fascination as he darted up the stairs like a grasshopper. Roger took the stairs two at a time and gave the iron door a hard shove. To his delight, Vladimir had only been bluffing - they hadn't bothered to lock it or even latch it behind them. The incredible weight prevented Roger from opening it quickly, but Vladimir was too stunned to follow, and as he shoved it gradually yawned wide enough for him to slip through. \"Mandrake, just what the hell do you think you're doing? Henrietta's busy, get after him!\" \"Yes, sir!\" Mandrake groaned as he got to his feet - Roger had evidently dealt him a very painful blow directly to the pelvis - and shuffled down the corridor after him. # Moments earlier...\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 214 George struggled to keep his emotions in check as the Rangers' heavy boots clomped down the stairs again. Their spurs clinked against the wood. \"All right gang,\" the lead one announced, \"Vladimir's given us some new orders. It's time to relocate.\" His muscles froze with fear. Changing rooms would not bode well for him at this point in the evening. How is Roger ever going to find me in here, he thought. His opportunities for escape seemed to be diminishing by the second. Mother Florence gripped the bars across from him and appeared to recite a silent prayer. Her children stared down at the floor, unwilling to face the tormentors. Things did not appear to be improving one bit. Oh well, I thought, we had a good run. I'm sure Roger is up there somewhere, maybe already dead, at peace. The end doesn't have to be so bad, after all. I won't care when I'm gone - my problems will all be solved.      You'll miss Dad, said another voice. This one came from deep dow. But he still had a will to fight. He might not have made contact with Roger yet, but there was still time. He felt in his heart that they still had a chance. Somewhere out there a loophole was waiting that would allow them to escape. They just had to uncover it. \"Where are you taking us?\" George called out. His voice shook noticeably. \"Upstairs,\" Martin answered gruffly. \"I won't go,\" he said, striking a resolute pose.  Luther and Martin exchanged a weary look, then strode over while taking out the ring of keys that Vladimir had presumably provided to them. Without another word, Martin, who was holding the keys, unlocked the door, stormed into the cell, and grabbed George by the ruff of his neck. Sharp pains shot through his shoulders at the iron grip,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 215 the fingers encased in leather gloves digging in deep enough to cause bruises that would appear later. He gasped out, doing his utmost not to burst into tears on the spot. As they dragged him down the corridor to face whatever destiny lay ahead, George began kicking his feet and writhing in resistance, though he quickly realized nothing would help him elude the grip of the pale rider who held him. Tears leaked from his eyes at a rate beyond his control, and he wondered with desperation what could have become of Roger. It felt like he was so close, though. Everything was finally going to be all right, and now things fell apart. He'd never felt more helpless in his entire life.   \"What about the others?\" he cried. \"You better not hurt them!\" \"Worry about yourself, you little rotter,\" Martin answered. He kept his eyes trained on the stairs up ahead, not sparing a glance to either side as he walked. He yanked George roughly by the arm - a bit harder and he might have dislocated the boy's shoulder. \"You're hurting me!\" he yelled. \"Won't matter for long, kid. Henrietta's going to take care of everything.\" With those words, he finally did look down at George, and flashed a chilling grin as he did so that revealed gold teeth in the corners of his tooth-line. Torchlight glinted off each tooth with dazzling brightness, though perhaps it was his imagination given the amount of time he'd already spent in the poorly lit dungeon. His mind filled with images of medieval torture chambers that he'd read about in books, which was presumably where the two men were taking him. At this point George had broken into a cold sweat, and his body went limp. Martin dutifully continued to drag him along, his feet bumping up the stairs, then gliding along the smooth parquet floor as he pulled him deeper into the house. Grim\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 216 visions of dancing devils appeared in the red, humming space behind his eyelids, and he feared that he might be on the verge of losing consciousness. The desperation for only one thing - to see Roger - struck him again in a wave. They were moving upstairs now, and some modicum of strength returned to his muscles. He unglued his eyelids, wiping away the demonic images that had appeared behind them a moment ago, and saw with shocking clarity the damp stone wall that lined the stairs as they climbed. George lifted his feet so as not to let them thump painfully over each step, and Martin's grip on his arm loosened somewhat, as if in gratitude. George considered opening his mouth to speak, but knew that nothing he could say would improve the situation. It was as though the men who held him captive were the furthest thing from human beings that could possibly exist, in spite of their outward appearances. At last, they came to a halt. Before them stood an arched door made of blood-red wood. A great iron ring was attached firmly in the middle for a handle. Below that, an oversized keyhole. Luther selected another key from his set and inserted it unceremoniously into the lock. The iron within turned clankily, and without a word, he hauled the door open by its center ring. What lay inside took George's breath away, and before he could even protest they had tossed him inside and slammed the door. He immediately got to his feet and ran back to the door, pounding his fists against the unyielding wood. \"Don't fight, it'll only make the transition harder!\" The voice diminished even before the sentence ended, and George could imagine Martin looking back over his shoulder to shout this last bit of morbid advice. What the room contained that had shocked him so badly was a crib, a mobile with tiny silver airplanes, as well as a fireplace\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 217 with logs burning heartily inside. Beside the crib was a closet with the door partially opened. Gaping blackness stared back at him from the gap. George was on his own there, so it seemed. Or am I? The hairs sticking up on the back of his neck somehow made it clear that there was some other presence in the room. His thoughts turned with dread to Henrietta. Is she here right this minute? \"You better believe it, my dear. Where else would I be?\" A hissing voice greeted his ears that emanated directly from the closet, accompanied by a rustling of scales that sounded like someone gently shaking a rainstick to and fro. \"Please, no - keep away from me,\" he stammered, doubtful that his words would have any effect. To his abject horror, the door began to creak open. God, no, make it stop. Roger where are you? Sure enough, a scaly head with odd feathers protruding from its snout emerged from the widening doorway, all fangs and dead black eyes. It was the face of a nightmare, and it was standing no more than eight feet away from the young boy, set to pounce. \"What are you going to do?\" If his voice had quaked any harder, the words would have been unintelligible. More of the beast's body came into view as she opened the door another few inches. \"There's something you need to understand here, Georgie,\" she hissed. \"We need you. Vladimir needs you. And we're not playing around any longer.\" Henrietta's bloated,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 218 piebald sides scraped with a rasp against the doorframe as she finally pushed her entire girth into view. \"We've been waiting a long time for this moment, he and I. You're a very special boy, George. Did you know that?\" \"No,\" he replied, \"what do you mean, 'special'?\" \"You're the one we've been waiting for all these years, don't you see! You're the one who can salvage Vladimir's empire, and bring this whole mess back under control! The locals have been getting a bit restless of late, you see, and...\" The mobile, shifted by some faint draft whose origins remained a mystery, suddenly began to rotate. The movement was followed by a jingling tune that seemed also to come from the closet, as if this monster had a music box stashed away in there. The tune was decidedly eerie - a kind of demented \"here-we go-'round-the-mulberry-bush\" that set George's skin crawling even more than it already was.      This is wrong, he thought. How can they possibly have the same nursery that I had when I was a baby?      [We have ways of seeing far beyond the normal limits], the reptile's voice replied. [You wouldn't believe the things we're capable of - and the things you can be capable of, too! All you need to do is trust in our ways. Let me guide you, and everything will be all right.]      After all that I'd been through, the words sounded painfully seductive. \"What are you going to do to me?\" George asked. He knew they were words of defeat, but almost wasn't sure if he cared anymore. He wanted the whole ordeal to be over. Warm, loving thoughts of Roger - and home - were slipping further from his mind by the minute. He felt dangerously resigned to the fact that he might never see the sun\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 219 reflecting off the white paint of their house in Maine again. The thought brought fresh tears to George's eyes. \"Why don't you start by relaxing,\" Henrietta whispered, the words oozing out like ladled honey. \"I'm going to take excellent care of you.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 220               CHAPTER 21  Darkness filled Roger's vision as he tried to find his way through the maze-like corridors, scanning for any sign that George might have been there. He heard the clap-clap-clap of Mandrake's footsteps in hot pursuit. In the musty-smelling hall he could make out an arched doorway at one end, possibly leading to a set of stairs. Beside him, however, was a strange series of cupboards - they had been installed along the wall by some skilled hand, from the looks of it. Mandrake was only a few steps away. Roger dashed forward two steps, then selected the closest knob he could find. The cupboard slid open to reveal a bare shelf within. The inside smelled like rat droppings, and reminded him of the cringe-worthy odors he would sometimes encounter while crawling around the rafters of the barn back home with George. He ignored the smell, and slid the door shut as quietly as he could manage. Boots skidded in the hall, and he knew Mandrake had arrived on the scene - and he wanted blood. You've embarrassed me in front of Vladimir, said the searching\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 221 thoughts that pecked at his mind like hot arrows. I'm gonna wring your scrawny little neck. Roger kept his guard up, and hugged his knees tighter, too scared even to breathe. [Just stay quiet!] A new voice broke through, and there was only one creature around here that could speak to him that way at this point. [Percy?! Where the hell are you? What is going on around here, where's Georgie? They had this horrible mannequin and he wasn't in his cell and I'm not sure if Mother Florence was down there and Mandrake is out there looking for me RIGHT NOW and...] [Just er... remain calm. I have at least part of the situation under control.] Heavy breathing issued from the hallway as his frazzled brain detected movement. Mandrake was inching forward, checking every space in the corridor... and it sounded like he was sniffing the air. The heavy breathing was interspersed with strangely dog-like chuffing noises as he apparently tried to sniff out the boy's location. \"Where are you, boy?\" he growled. \"I got a nose like a bloodhound, so you better come out of whatever rathole you've gone and stuck yourself into.\" Roger's teeth began to chatter. Shit. Mandrake heard the clicking. He was on the cabinet like a hawk that had spotted a mouse. The ghoulish manservant flung the cupboard door open hard enough to rip it from its hinges, where it clattered away along the floorboards of the corridor. The silty light of the hall - what little there was - illuminated Roger's pale, terrified face. It was the face of a victim completely at the mercy of their tormentor. A lecherous grin already stretched from ear to ear on Mandrake's lips, revealing teeth that actually seemed to consist of multiple rows, like a shark's, and gave off the distinct appearance that he had taken a file to them for sharpening. His eyes gleamed with murderous abandon.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 222 His gnarled fingers unfurled and became claws that stretched out to grab Roger. He shrank back against the inside wall of the cupboard, praying for some miracle that would allow him to disappear entirely. [Percy, what do I do?!] His mind was teetering on the sharp edge of panic. A few more seconds and he'd be no more competent than a raving madman. [Scream at him, spit at him, do anything you can! Do everything in your power not to let him touch you!] \"Oh, Percy,\" he moaned out loud, his voice dripping with fear. \"Where are you?\" This time he got no response.  # \"That bastard boy has thrown a wrench in my gears for the last time,\" Vladimir muttered, barely able to contain his rage. He was standing in front of the cell that still held three prisoners: Mother Florence and her family. All three barely appeared to be listening, their eyes glued to the grotesque George-doll shuffling about in the opposite cell. Finally, the woman was able to divert her gaze and address the king. \"I don't care what you do with me, Vladimir, just please don't harm the children,\" she said. \"I'm begging you.\"  \"But don't you see, Abby?\" he said, using her first name, the way he had when they'd first met. \"I need them for the machine. What do you think it runs on, corn oil?\" He scoffed. \"You could have been my queen, you know. Haven't you shouldered the burden of single motherhood long enough?\" At these words, she clutched her children closer. Their fingers dug into the cloth of her dress.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 223 \"I would rather die than stand by your side,\" she whispered. \"As you wish,\" he replied with a dismissive wave of his hand. He turned to leave. \"You have an hour to say goodbye to them; then it will be their turn to get acquainted with Henrietta.\" A burst of laughter gushed from his lips, laced with insanity. \"She can be quite persuasive, you know!\" With that, he sauntered down the corridor and up the dungeon steps, out of sight. The iron door clanged shut behind him, and this time he made sure to slam the massive deadbolt into place. There will be no more escape attempts tonight, he thought. # Mandrake's fingers closed around Roger's neck.  He hoped that dying would not be painful. He had heard stories that sometimes people saw a white light at the very end. He felt the pressure increase on the bones around his throat, and his vision began to sway and blur. \"Please... stop...\" he managed to gasp out in a strangled sob. It seemed as though a powerful vacuum had sucked all the air out of the cupboard. Then, just as the last of his vision had begun to recede into darkness, Mandrake's hands flew off his neck in such a rapid motion that his nails left three fine scratches just along Roger's jugular. A massive crash came not a split second later, followed by the clomp of heavy boots on the hardwood floor. His mind was blanketed with confusion, but his body knew enough to choke down big gulps of air, which even in the musty, cramped space of the cupboard tasted wonderful. Howls of pain - presumably Mandrake's - filled his ears.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 224 \"How does that feel, ya lout?\" shouted a man with a British accent. Roger knew that voice. He heard a dull crack in the space to the left where he could not see, but knew Mandrake lay. The sound could only have been a boot colliding with his ribs. \"Why don't you try picking on someone your own size,\" another voice said. [Percy, it's the Grimsrud brothers!] Roger cried out in his mind. He prayed the bird could hear him. \"Brothers, please! You're making a grievous mistake! There is still time to stop this insanit-\" His voice was cut off by another dull thud as someone else decided to take a whack at him. Roger knew well the names of the three men now standing in the corridor who had saved his life: Daniel, Cassius, and Isaac. I knew they'd come, he thought, and smiled. # George was in a trance. Henrietta beckoned to him with eyes shaped like almonds. George could even make out a white film glistening there, spread over the lenses like some spoiled butter. Nonetheless, his legs carried him forward. Her jaws began to stretch, the hinges creaking audibly. Countless teeth filled the space between her lips and tongue. [That's right, come closer. I'm going to transform you, Georgie. You'll soon see it's for the best.] Strangely enough, he was starting to believe her. [Will I ever see Roger again?] [You may. Only time will tell if Vladimir sees fit to use you both.] [Use us?] [Oh yes, but don't worry, it's a very pleasant position to be in. The rewards will be more bountiful than you can possibly imagine. Doesn't that sound nice, Georgie?]\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 225 [I guess...] He was now standing right before Henrietta. The forked tongue flicked out to taste the air, thus tasting George's scent, and somewhere in the back of his mind the last dull-red flashes of fear began to fade. [Maybe staying here won't be so bad, after all.] [That's the spirit! Now, just a bit closer, and I'll put every last one of your fears to rest. I think you're going to like how it feels.] [Isn't there another way?] This tiny voice that spoke up now was one of desperation. She clucked in a way that was strangely mother-like. [George, don't you see? Vladimir can't run this empire alone, he needs young soldiers like you to help him carry on the fight!] [Soldier?] [Yes, George. Haven't you ever wanted to be a soldier, fighting for the greatest army the Realm has ever known?] Her fangs oozed with clear drops of liquid that could only be venom. That's when the door shattered in a hail of splinters and mangled hinges. George whirled around, ducking just in time to narrowly avoid a piece of twisted metal that whistled past his head. Behind him, Henrietta flinched at the massive noise and backed her hindquarters into the closet in a semi-retreat. [What is the meaning of this?!] Her thoughts screamed out in anger and surprise. Whoever had opened the door had done so with more than just a sturdy kick. Faint wisps of purple smoke curled around the doorframe, and George smelled something that reminded him of the time Roger singed his hair with a match, just to see\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 226 what would happen. A cough sputtered past his lips as he tried to make out the figures standing in the hazy entrance where the door had stood a second before. There were two of them.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 227               CHAPTER 22  From where Roger sat, crammed in the cupboard with pins and needles crawling all over his legs, the sound of the crash somewhere above was just as audible as if he'd been standing in the hallway. The brothers took a break from whaling on Mandrake long enough to consider the source of the racket, and he could picture them cocking their ears towards the ceiling in unison, just beyond the sides of his vision. \"What in the hell was that?\" one of them exclaimed. \"I don't know, but we better move - the other boy may be in mortal danger.\" That must be Daniel, Roger thought excitedly; he could hear the grave authority in his voice, a rocky tone that seemed to emanate from deep within his throat. [Percy, are you there?] Roger thought as hard as he could. [They've actually come to rescue us!] [I've got some good news, kid.] Percy's voice was a clear and brilliant stream that actually seemed to convey his emotions as well. That had never happened before. There was excitement and optimism there, making Roger feel as though he was the one with a pair of wings - only, they weren't broken, and he could fly off at any second.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 228 [Well, what is it then?] he asked. Mandrake lay puffing on the floor - Roger could see his legs, and the buckled shoes on his feet that stuck out past the open cupboard door. They twitched a little, and a shudder suddenly racked his spine. [That crash upstairs? I think a couple more soldiers may have just joined the resistance against Vladimir.] [The Rangers? But why would they suddenly decide to help us?] [Maybe they were planning it all along. Maybe Vladimir did something to them once, too.] \"You'll... you'll pay for this, all of you. Vladimir knows how to deal with traitors to the Realm...\" Mandrake spat the words through clenched teeth. \"Oh, stuff it up your ass, Mandrake,\" said Isaac. He punctuated the sentence with another swift kick to the servant's ribs. Mandrake's feet sprang into the air, then lay still. Roger didn't think that Mandrake felt like adding anything to his previous statement. \"My brothers, we're wasting time. One of you stay here, the other man and I will make our way upstairs.\" Roger still couldn't really see anything, but he could sense them shuffling around self-consciously, their hunting boots lightly scuffing the stone floor. \"You don't know what you'll be dealing with up there,\" said one. Cassius, he guessed. He was getting good at identifying them as his memory worked to pin faces to names. \"All three of us should go. This one'll be safe here on his own... for now.\" \"Come off it man, you must be joking. The second we leave, Vladimir'll be here and the boy will be done for. He needs a bodyguard. We didn't come on this mission just to muck it up at the most critical moment.\" Daniel paused. \"I'm not sure you truly fathom what's at stake here,\" he added.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 229 \"And then when Vladimir comes, you think we'll stand a chance?\" Mandrake made an attempt to get up, which Isaac quashed with a boot pressed firmly against his chest. He went back down with a thump. Roger had finally managed to rearrange the awkward configuration of limbs in a way that allowed him to peer out and get his first good look at the situation. Three towering bodies stood over him. \"Hello, son,\" Daniel said. He stepped forward, at the same time extending a hand the size of a catcher's mitt.  \"We've come to send you and your brother home.\" \"You've all got to be joking. The clear solution is to take him with us.\" Isaac said this while casting frantic glances up and down the corridor. Daniel was still staring down at Roger after saying he'd get the boys home. Home. The concept hadn't occurred to Roger in so long that he'd almost begun to forget it even existed. Thoughts and images swirled in his mind of that beautiful place - rolling hills of uncut grass that swayed in the summer breeze, frogs casting ripples as they jumped off the bank into the pond, and in the field beyond the garden, the cemetery where he and George used to troop out with sticks of charcoal clutched in their hands to make grave rubbings. He could have that again. The brothers had filled his heart with hope. Almost as soon as Isaac had finished what he was saying, however, the sound of hurried footsteps reached their ears, echoing spookily from some other nearby passage. Cold terror seized Roger as he felt Vladimir getting closer. He imagined it was how Theseus might have felt when he listened to the Minotaur clip-clopping around in the\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 230 labyrinth. There was no doubt that a terrible beast lived in this house, and he was out for blood. \"We have to move!\" Daniel hissed. Mandrake showed no signs of resistance, aside from a poisonous glare. At last Roger popped himself out of the dank-smelling cupboard and all but collapsed on the floor, thumping his left knee smartly on the wood. Despite the flare of pain, he dragged himself to attention before the three brothers as they evaluated their escape routes. \"Where did that noise come from?\" Cassius asked, his voice fierce with anxiety. \"Let's try those stairs,\" Daniel responded. He gestured at a bulge in the wall that looked like one side of a tower. Next to the corridor, an opening appeared to lead to a spiral staircase built within that same tower. The footsteps were getting closer.  The brothers took off like a shot, and Roger scampered after them, trying to keep pace. He glanced back for one final look at Mandrake, badly beaten and lying on the floor, then bounded around the corner and up the stairs.  # No sooner had the Grimsrud brothers and Roger disappeared from view than Vladimir came marching into the corridor. The old dungeon-keeper Mandrake lay immobile on the floor, still trying to catch his breath, and wincing from the beating the brothers inflicted. Vladimir knelt beside him, taking one hand in a way that seemed almost paternal. \"Tell me where they went,\" Vladimir demanded in a sharp tone. His nostrils flared and his face looked flushed. A shine of perspiration had taken over his brow,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 231 which was usually dry as a bone. Roger had eluded his grasp for several minutes too long already, and a black, rage-inducing frustration flowed through Vladimir's veins. His blood was hot with anger. Never in his long life had he felt so helpless to prevent a situation from spiraling dangerously out of his control. \"That way, master,\" Mandrake gasped in reply. \"They heard a crash upstairs - I think we may be in serious trouble.\" \"The words of a coward. I expected nothing less from you, Mandrake. You've always been a louse.\" Now there was a dead look in Vladimir's eyes. \"Because of you, irreparable damage may already be done. For all I know, those boys won't even be useful to me after this. How will I power my machine then? Have any of these considerations even once entered your pitiful mind?\" Mandrake regarded him with a deepening terror. Now he knew what the stakes were; now he knew the severity of his mistake in letting Roger slip past. \"The brothers are here!\" he cried. \"They took him, and now they're trying to get George.\" \"I'm not worried about that,\" Vladimir said, his eyes filled with ice. \"What does concern me is the lack of competence in my servants. I fear several of them - not just the brothers - have already turned against me.\" He sighed. \"Maybe my power really is waning, Mandrake.\" Mandrake tried to sit up, but Vladimir forced him back down, planting a hand firmly on his chest. \"Easy there, soldier, you're in no position to go anywhere.\" \"But sir, it's not just the brothers! There was a loud crash upstairs, then I heard a strange sort of crackling, and I caught the scent of burning hair. Don't you know what\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 232 that means? It's the same type of spell the Rangers used to use when I would go along with them to raid farmhouses - they've turned against you as well, I fear, and they are here now! I alone have remained faithful, sire!\" He seemed to have a great deal of difficulty speaking. The Grimsruds may have inflicted more damage on him than appearances would hint at, Vladimir thought. \"Henrietta will take care of them. A powerful sorceress lies hidden beneath her scaly exterior, but I don't need to tell you that.\" \"What are you going to do?\" \"First, Mandrake, I think it's time you were held accountable for the error you committed in letting Roger slip past you. I can't have failures like that threatening my hold on the Realm, wouldn't you agree?\" \"Master, what are you saying?\" Vladimir withdrew a short dagger, which he'd kept concealed behind his back. \"What I'm saying, Mandrake, is this: I've decided to officially - and permanently - terminate your employment. Vladimir plunged the dagger deep into his chest.  Mandrake's eyes flew wide open in horror. A sharp crack sound filled the air as Vladimir split his breastbone. A gout of blood sprayed the air as Vladimir twisted the knife deeper, burying it up to the hilt. Mandrake's lips immediately began to stain a dark red, and several drops leaked out of his mouth. \"Master... why?\" he moaned, the voice of a man at death's door. \"You've failed to live up to my expectations, Mandrake. This can be the only possible ending to your tale, I'm afraid.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 233 Sobs racked the dying man's body as he realized his moment of oblivion was close at hand. Vladimir held the knife firm. A pool of blood oozed onto the floor, already beginning to thicken. Mandrake's legs twitched as Vladimir twisted the knife even deeper - and then all was still. Vladimir stood, leaving the silver dagger implanted in his hapless victim and former servant. Turning back in the direction from whence he had come, Vladimir walked into the grand dining hall, then to his favorite armchair at the head of the massive table, and sat down to wait. It won't be long at all now, he thinks. The hour of reckoning had come at last.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 234               CHAPTER 23  Bounding up the mottled wooden steps, Roger's heart felt like it was going to explode. Furthermore, he hadn't had anything to eat since Percy's meager provisions on the train, and the lack of fuel was beginning to take a serious toll. His vision seemed fuzzy, and his breath was short. Nevertheless, he managed to tap into his last stores of energy to make the climb. The brothers' long legs allowed them to take the steps two at a time with ease, but Roger stayed close behind. The spiral staircase carried them higher and higher until Roger was sure they had to be standing somewhere over the main roof of the building. The rafters groaned from below as fierce gusts of wind continued to pound the house. Roger tried to remain calm while they maintained our ascent. He was sick with fear for George's well-being, and he knew he shouldn't accept the fact that the brothers had shown up as definitive proof that their rescue was at hand. He wondered if the situation might not have gotten worse, in fact. At last, they reached a small wooden landing that featured a small picture window set in the center of the wall. Beside it lay the remains of a door. Hunks of debris\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 235 littered the opening where some unimaginable force had burst through in a fit of destructive energy. The stink of burning hair filled their nostrils, and Roger felt his stomach perform a neatly executed backflip. The brothers blocked his view of what the room contained, but he already knew George was somewhere in there. What he didn't know was what Henrietta had done to him. \"George, you in there?\" he cried.  No response.  Cassius threw a poisonous backwards glance at him, one finger mashed against his lips. They crept forward, entering the room with the utmost caution. No one appeared to be inside. Before they had advanced one step closer, however, a piercing cry resounded from the depths of a closet at the back of the room. \"George!\" he screamed. Roger dashed forward, wrenching the door open with what felt like strength he'd never possessed before. Some invisible force had been holding the door shut from within, though in his fear and desperation he was able to summon enough power to overcome it. When he looked inside, however, his mind could not prepare him for the horror that his eyes were now forced to register. The brothers themselves staggered backward, retching, as soon as they had made the grievous error of seeking a better look over my shoulder. \"What the...\" Roger whispered. Inside the closet hung several objects that looked like pink pajamas - the kind with the butt-flap and the booties - only they were shriveled and gray, like no clothing he'd ever seen in his life. As shock subsided and realization set in, Roger realized he was looking at the skins of children. Somewhere beyond the wall of darkness that\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 236 surrounded the rear of the closet (though he sincerely doubted that it was just a closet, at this point), salacious sounds of dripping greeted my ears. Numb horror filled his mind like a block of ice. Something clicked on the stones back there, and Roger instantly thought of talons. Behind him, one of the brothers wrenched a torch from the wall, which cast warm light over the place from which the sounds had emitted, but his thoughts - and eyes - were still on the ragged pink monstrosities draped along the wall, like a housekeeper's forgotten laundry, clumsily tacked up in a hurry without forethought of wear or tear. He drained them like a spider shucking a fly, Roger thought. His eyelids fluttered and his forehead felt hot. He looked over to where the light had shone. A lizard-like creature stood over George.  \"Get away from him!\" he shouted instinctively. George lay limp before a hideous beast that looked like a cross between a Komodo dragon and a flying dinosaur. Its jaws craned open, and its forked tongue lolled down like a slack red cord.  George showed no signs of life. \"Down, son, get out of the way!\" Cassius roared, stepping lively to the forefront and giving Roger a brusque shove to get him moving. The thing hissed at the intrusion of the torchlight. Its head writhed on a smooth-muscled neck before snapping about in one smooth motion to face the intruders. [Who dares disturb the extraction process?] The thought screamed into Roger's head like a runaway train, shrieking at a frequency that made his molars grind. Evidently, the brothers heard it too - they each bore identical grimaces of pain, clutching at their ears and instinctively retreating a step or two.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 237 \"It's Henrietta, the foul lizard-slave of Cruor! Advance on her, brothers, we'll soon weather this storm!\" They charged. As fast as the action picked up, things changed right before Roger's eyes. As soon as the brothers had begun to gather momentum, they suddenly staggered backwards, their hands raised as if trying to maintain balance in the face of a stiff wind; apparently Henrietta was using something considerably stronger on them. [What are you doing to them? What are those things on the wall??] Roger cried. [By which you mean ... ? Ah, yes! My prized possessions. You see, master Roger, Vladimir requires an abundance of willing young souls to volunteer for a... well, yes, let's call it what it is - for a sacrifice, of sorts.] She paused, turning to look back at George's body, who lay helpless on the cold floor. Her tongue flicked out, tasting the air, probably smelling Roger's fear and repulsion. [You see - Vladimir needs their blood to run the machine. Without it, all control over the Realm would be lost. So, you see, I keep these trophies as a way to honor the lives that these children have sacrificed, their own lives, Roger, can you imagine? Would that you too were to become such a hero one day.] [Care to see a demonstration?] she asked. Roger glanced back and saw that the bearded trio had regained some composure. Roger appeared to have diverted some of Henrietta's attention, at least for the moment. Her head sank lower. Roger tried to move, and found that his feet were completely immobilized. He tugged at his knees, but they refused to budge.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 238 He watched in abject horror as one meaty lip curled back to reveal twin fangs, which dripped with venom. They closed the distance to George's arm in a liquid motion, and both fangs slowly sank into the flesh of my little brother's bicep.  Roger began to scream.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 239               CHAPTER 24  Vladimir sat faithfully at his post and drummed his fingers on the oaken table. He rested his back against the ornate armchair, carved thousands of years ago by hands even he had forgotten. Patience had always been a great virtue of his - the decades before he seized power passed like so many minutes on a clock, and even he could not quite remember how many centuries had drifted by since the time of his own birth. His furrowed brow and gnarled fingers gave little actual indication to the tyrant king's age, but one would not be mistaken in estimating that he had looked the same way for longer than anyone else in the Realm. It was as though he was immune to time entirely. The screams resounding from upstairs did not concern him in the least, nor did they create any further anxiety that things were getting any more out of control than they already were. Killing Mandrake had invoked a kind of calm in him, a deep and abiding sense that at least one loose end had been tied up, and the only thing left to do was wait for everything else to come to its logical conclusion. Henrietta would work her special brand of magic on the boys - or, on one of them, at the very least, he thought. Like Mandrake, she was guilty of at least a few slip-ups over the past several months -\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 240 but with her help, and a little luck, the great machine would have enough fuel to run for a dozen more harvests, if not more. The weather would bend to his touch again, once the life-force of the boys had been harnessed, and the townsfolk Realm-wide would bow to his will once more. No great cause for concern, he thought, a smug look plastered on his face. He fingered the rim of his brandy glass - he had to summon one of the kitchen hands to pour the drink, an elderly half-breed named Burnside. Alcohol had never been a great force in his life, but Vladimir enjoyed a a fine drink to sip on from time to time. His impartiality to liquor might have been ironic, given the farmers and the crops he oversaw, but a king needed a sober hand to steady his heavy crown. With all the patience in the world, Vladimir drummed his fingers, and waited. The knuckles of his right hand were spattered with Mandrake's blood.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 241               CHAPTER 25  Roger tried to call his brother's name, but the sound became lodged in his throat like an oversized chunk of meat. His vocal chords seemed to freeze and atrophy as a reaction to the horror that was unfolding before his very eyes, and black spots began appearing in his vision as he struggled to hold onto consciousness. Behind him, Cassius, Daniel and Isaac clutched their heads in obvious agony, the force of Henrietta's thoughts still managing to keep them at bay. The lizard's teeth probed even deeper into Georgie's arm like hypodermic needles, and Roger prayed that whatever venom they might contain would not be lethal. George's body lay still as a corpse, and Roger's feet remained glued to the floor. That's when he noticed two more figures draped over the west wall of the bizarre nursery, where the mobile still spun crazily in the air. Hanging on hooks like pink, custom-tailored suits were the men that Roger had heard mention of only as the Rangers, and whom Roger had grown to fear as the eventual harbingers of his doom. Their eyes, teeth, and bones were gone, as though they had never existed in the first place, and the clothes they had traveled the Realm in lay in a crumpled pile on the floor\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 242 next to their bodies. Something terrible had happened here. The Rangers had busted down the door to save George, but Henrietta had somehow disposed of them with her black magic. Roger shuddered to think what they might have experienced in their dying moments. All these thoughts passed through his mind in a matter of seconds. Henrietta had dug her fangs in so deeply that her upper lip was now wrapped around the curve of George's bicep, the way a child's mouth might greedily envelope the spout of a water bottle on a hot day. It was then that Henrietta actually began to slurp at the small body. Juicy sucking noises echoed throughout the chamber, reminding Roger of George's failed experiment one morning at breakfast to eat a grapefruit without the aid of a spoon. The sound was maddening, but suddenly, pure white hope filled his chest. In that moment, his legs finally felt as though they were coming loose. Roger pulled again at his right knee, which to his delight rose an inch off the floor. It was what he imagined it might feel like to tug a log out of a puddle of softening tar. He dragged at the other leg with all his might, and felt that one come out of its sticking place as well. The more he pulled, the freer he became, and in his mind he all but shouted the lyrical shield I had come to depend on, the lyrics running into a blur. I had said that first verse over and over again so many times that the words themselves were beginning to sound like an alien language. (Getcher-modor-rahnin, Heddoud-ontha-hi-whey...) Again and again, until they spiraled in and out of my thoughts, and I couldn't even be sure any longer if I hadn't begun to say the words out loud as well, images and\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 243 words and the horror of what this creature was doing to my sibling all swirling into one discombobulated mess, but I held fast. [Roger, listen to me, this is Percy! I'm down here in the dining hall with Vladimir, setting up a little surprise. He doesn't know I'm here, but you have to listen carefully!] [Percy, what on earth am I going to do? You have to help me, this monster is killing George!] Roger thought. [It's not too late! Only you can get close enough to mortally wound her - your mind is not of the Realm, and she cannot control it. The brothers, and the Rangers - they spent their whole lives in this place, and she knows how to corrupt their channels of perception. But you must keep your guard up, and find a weapon - and use it - before she has managed to completely drain your brother's life force! If we can get him back to your world before the transformation is complete, I think he'll survive.] Roger continued to struggle with his uncooperative legs while carrying on the mental conversation with Percy. [Oh, Percy, her teeth are in his arm, I'm looking right at it...] [The extraction process is deceptively slow. She must have spent several minutes working on the Rangers before she turned her attention to George, and then you and those bearded rescuers showed up. Roger, you mustn't waste any more time, seize a weapon and act now, while she's distracted!] The low slurping sound went on like a dull roar in his ears. He wiggled both legs, and to his surprise was met with complete freedom of movement. Roger froze so as not to alert the beast he was loose any more than he already had, and turned his attention to the bearded trio that had so far only proven themselves capable of beating up old Mandrake - a deed Roger was grateful for, to be sure, but this room and its inhabitant\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 244 had drained away nearly all their power, leaving them no more fearsome than three hairy babies. Cassius, their leader, was now slumped in a corner with his head in his hands, and Roger thought he could detect the thin sounds of crying. Black bristles stuck out from beneath his palms, and though his two brothers were somehow still on their feet, they covered their faces in identical fashion. Low moans of pain emitted from behind their splayed fingers. The torch they had been carrying lay on the stone floor, its flame sputtering and struggling to find purchase and stay alive on the damp stone floor. Roger's eyes traveled to Cassius's belt, and the torch light sparkled on the blade of a heavy stone axe that the Grimsrud had slung there for protection. Roger wondered what other weapons they'd brought with them. Roger knew his only chance to save George had come at last. The grotesque bird-like lizard was draining George like a juice box, and soon there'd be nothing left but a dry, hollowed-out husk, one more skin to line the walls of this chamber of horrors. His clothes had even begun to crumple, as though the skin and bones underneath were dissolving into ash and collapsing downward.  Time was running out. Roger gripped the head of the axe and slipped it out through the loop in Cassius's belt. The big man barely reacted. The wooden grip felt heavy and reassuring in his grip, and he hefted it around into a comfortable swinging position. The slurping sounds had abated somewhat, as though the enemy sensed that something had gone wrong. Indeed it had, for her - the lapse in concentration on keeping Roger stuck had allowed Roger to grab the axe, but now she withdrew her fangs and turned to face him. Her hideous yellow eyes gleamed in the torchlight.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 245 [Foul human, you have meddled in our affairs for the last time!]  Roger closed the distance in two quick strides and brought the hatchet down with every ounce of strength he had. The blow cleaved the loathsome creature's brain in two with one blow. Henrietta crumpled to the floor like a punctured balloon. There was a twitch, a slight shake of the tail - and then all was still. The voice that had screeched into Roger's head like a flock of banshees a second earlier had been silenced for all time. Blood gushed from the massive head wound in gentle spurts, splashing against the embedded blade of the hatchet.  George lay as still as the creature that had tried to kill him, and the twin fang-holes glowed an angry red on his arm. The bicep had swollen significantly, while the rest of his body looked emaciated. Roger pulled his brother away from the Henrietta's carcass and knelt beside him, water pouring from his eyes. His tears hit the stone floor with a barely audible patter. \"George, wake up, please, you have to wake up!\" he wailed. With Henrietta dead, the three brothers were able to compose themselves, and they huddled around the two boys to evaluate the damage. Roger turned to the first one who came near - Isaac - and started to pound his fists against the giant's legs. \"Where were you? You came here to rescue us and now look what's happened! He's dead, oh God, I think he's really dead...\"  Isaac gripped him forcefully by the shoulders and gave him a brisk shake. Meanwhile, Daniel bent down to George to check for a pulse. \"Get ahold of yourself, boy, he's not finished yet,\" he said in a voice that was calm and reassuring, though by no means downplaying the severity of the situation. Isaac\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 246 continued to hold Roger in place, although their leader's words had sent another bolt of hope through him. \"George...?\" he sniffed. He pulled away from Isaac and crouched by his little brother's side once more. As he leaned in closer, he realized that George was breathing, although they were the shallowest breaths Roger had ever heard a person take. His thin chest rose and fell in tiny shudders. \"We have to get him out of here,\" Roger said, trying to get his emotions back under control. \"He'll die if you don't help us get home. Please.\" \"True enough, son,\" Cassius said. \"How do we leave the Realm?\" Roger asked. Cassius rose after appearing to check several more vital signs. Basic medical training! Roger thought. These guys are full of surprises.  \"The return portal will remain open until midnight,\" Daniel said. \"If I heard correctly, the clock chimed ten almost an hour ago, so we have no time to spare. Only...\" \"What, what is it?\" Roger cried. His patience had all but run out. He tried not to look at George, whose ashen cheeks had sunken in to make faint shadows as his body fought to keep breathing. \"Well... Vladimir isn't exactly in the business of letting prisoners walk for free,\" Daniel said. \"I have a feeling he's waiting for us downstairs this very minute.\" Thinking back to Percy's words, Roger already knew how right he was. But his short-term memory brought to the surface another tidbit of Percy's wisdom that had filled him with optimism and intrigue - something about a trap the bird was preparing. That, and the fact that his feathered comrade still had the element of surprise on his\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 247 side: he and Vladimir were in the same dining hall, but the evil king had by no means detected the bird's presence.  Maybe we still have a chance of getting out of here alive, after all, Roger thought. # \"Do I have to face him alone, then?\" Roger demanded. Cassius sighed, then bent down again to cradle George's head. \"Of course not. All our lives have been leading to this moment, and I'll be damned if we're going to skitter off into the night and throw you and your brother to the wolves. This conflict with Vladimir goes back longer than any of us can remember, and that's saying a long way back, my son. You just happened to come on through that portal and land right smack in the middle of it. Funny how that works.\" \"Why, though? I still don't understand why he chose us.\" \"No one can say for sure, son. Our best guess is that he sensed some connection - some signal that was powerful enough to extend through the cosmosphere, or whatever it is that separates our world from yours.\" Roger thought back to my father's record collection, and the fascination that that sheaf of wheat on the Traffic album cover had elicited. He remembered the countless times he had gingerly lifted the needle on his father's dusty old phonograph to hear that song from the top once more, so he could imagine the English peasants throwing their backs into the motion of the scythes as they cut barley from the stalk, wicking sweat from their brows between swings. Perhaps that had been it all along; his enchantment with an old album from the 60's had given way to a universe-bending fissure, through\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 248 which Vladimir Cruor was actually able to pick him out. His absorption with the namesake song had allowed him to do so. \"And do you know why he needs us?\" Roger asked. \"I fear the details may be too graphic for you to handle,\" Daniel replied, his voice cold. \"The boy is old enough, brother. He's done more growing up over the past Realm-cycle than most other species half his age, from what I've read. Not bad for a regular human.\" Cassius turned his face back down to the boy after this reproach. \"I'm afraid that what Henrietta was doing to your brother was the same thing that she's succeeded in doing to countless other boys and girls - some from the Realm, others from distant worlds, like you - with the aim of providing a sort of fuel for Vladimir. For him, and for the infernal machine he uses to manipulate the climate.\" \"Vladimir Cruor can control that?\" \"That's right,\" he replied. \"Several decades ago, Vladimir decided to commission a massive project with all the gold he'd reaped from tributes paid to him by the farmers of the Realm - people like us. They built him a machine, with one grave warning. You see, the druids are a querulous people that never migrated down from the north, and no one here would have any reason to go see them unless it was for some vile purpose that inevitably ended in suffering. In this spirit did Vladimir venture to their sphere of the world, eventually returning with a team of some 700 pack mules to haul the contraption home to this very mansion, all packed in an enormous crate wrapped in chains and secured with modern-looking padlocks. This I know from the stories our parents used to tell, but no one has seen the machine for themselves and lived, other than members of Vladimir's loyal entourage, I suppose.\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 249 Roger threw a glance over his shoulder at the bled-white corpse of the creature he had just vanquished, and felt the hairs on his neck stand up. An acrid odor like rotting meat and decaying leaves stung his nostrils and caused him to turn back in a hurry. \"How do we stop it then?\" he asked, all-too-aware of the lateness of the hour. \"I'm afraid the machine may be indestructible,\" said Isaac, sounding glum. \"Now, now, brother, you know that isn't quite true,\" Cassius responded in a chiding voice. \"We can conquer it with a war of attrition.\" He paused briefly for effect. Roger tapped his foot impatiently for him to continue. \"It was no accident that Vladimir hedged his bets by bringing two boys over to the Realm. He knew that he could double his chances of keeping the device operational with two fuel sources, in case one of you didn't survive the extraction process, or proved incompatible as a source.\" Roger barely had any idea what he was talking about. \"So?\" he demanded. \"If he failed to harvest even one of you, the machine would have nothing left to run on. Vladimir would lose his grip on the seasons and weather in the Realm, and thus lose all his power.\" Daniel spoke up: \"I believe he's right, Roger. Events beyond your comprehension have been progressing towards this moment for longer than even we can remember.\" Roger couldn't believe what he was hearing. All he wanted to do was get home with George and dissolve the foul curse that Henrietta had laid upon him - but if there's a way to prevent future children from suffering the same fate, he thought, then I have to see this thing through to the end. He tugged on George's hand to try and get a response out of him, but George's wrist hung limp in his palm. Suddenly, he knew what to do.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 250 \"We have to get him to Mother Florence,\" Roger said. \"She's the only one who can get him back on his feet, I know it.\" He paused, thinking hard. \"I need you three to distract Vladimir. Percy will help you. He's in there now setting a trap. If the machine is almost dead, then Vladimir should be weak - right?\" \"We were prepared for just such a confrontation, and yes, we believe that his powers may have diminished significantly along with the machine. With it, he could control not only the seasons, but the minds of the Realm's inhabitants as well. It's a trick he's been using for centuries, passed down from his ancestors, who were also druids, most likely.\"      These guys sure have a way of beating around the bush, Roger thought. We need a little more direct action around here. \"Well, have you brought anything with you that might help?\" Roger asked. He was already crouched down by Georgie's side, trying to loop one arm around his neck and figure out how he was going to carry him all the way down to the dungeon. \"I think we might've packed just the thing,\" Daniel said with the ghost of a smile.    # As it just so happened, the brothers had picked the right tools for the job - at least, that's how Roger felt when he saw the row of three gleaming scythes leaning against the wall in the foyer where they had first come in. They had descended the stairs that led up to Henrietta's lair like thieves in the night, and George's pale body was draped over Cassius's shoulder like a ghostly sack of potatoes. \"You know how to ... fight with those things?\" He asked in wonder.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 251 Isaac muttered something about \"special training\" in his low, gravelly voice, and went over to the wall to pick up his scythe. As he hefted it in the warm light of the corridor, Roger noticed that his name was etched in gold on the handle, just above the place where his left hand would go. Isaac stepped back and gave the blade a few lazy test swings. It whistled softly through the air, and looked impossibly sharp. Cassius carefully removed George from his shoulder and propped him up against the stone wall at the side of the passage, then motioned for Roger to come over. \"This is it for us,\" he said. \"We may not emerge from that room alive, but if we do, you'll know that things are safe. You must go to Mother Florence, now! Your brother may not have long to live!\" He patted Roger on the back and helped him lift George until he was draped over one shoulder in a fireman's carry as before. Roger could actually feel the life draining out of him, it seemed. His body felt impossibly light, and the ease with which he carried his little brother scared him deeply. \"Godspeed, young man,\" Cassius said. \"See you on the other side.\" They hefted their scythes into what Roger assumed was a fighting position and strode off down the long hall, towards the dining hall, and their final confrontation with Vladimir Cruor. Roger turned back in the other direction and made his way to the cellar door that guarded the dungeon where his brother had spent God knew how many hours - practically the full duration of his time in the Realm, Roger realized. A giddy thought occurred to him: that he had probably had more fun than on this trip, though the idea that this was supposed to be some kind of rollicking adventure felt totally inappropriate. This was a matter of life and death, and if I didn't act fast, and with impeccable judgment, I would soon be short one little brother named George.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 252 The huge latch released with surprising ease in Roger's hand, as the door hadn't been locked since Mandrake and Vladimir had come down to introduce him to that bizarre replacement they had manufactured. The mannequin, with those dead glass eyes, Roger remembered with ill horror. It's probably still down there. What if it attacks us? He had no idea what kind of abilities it might or might not possess. More dull fear creeped into his senses, and he had to make a conscious effort to stop his knees from shaking. The door creaked open, revealing torchlit steps that led down into that dark place - made only a few degrees brighter by the knowledge that Mother Florence and her children might be waiting down there to deliver us from evil. No sooner had he placed his foot on the first step, than a horrible wailing rose up from the depths of the chamber. It sounded like the wails of a grieving woman, but the voice bore little resemblance to that of Mother Florence. The sound stopped him in his tracks, and sent a wave of shivers running all up and down his spine. Despite George's lack of weight, he even came close to losing his balance in that moment, which would have sent them both to take a nasty fall down the stone steps. Then, almost as abruptly as it had begun, the wailing stopped. \"Mother Florence?\" Roger called out. There was no immediate response. Cold sweat stood out on his forehead, and he redistributed George's weight on his shoulder. Again, the miserable wail rose like a siren, and he finally had to give up and put Georgie down, so great was the need (oh God make it stop please) to cover his ears. Outrage suddenly coursed through him without warning. He had put up with so much shit in this godforsaken place, encountering so many people\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 253 and creatures whose existence made absolutely no sense, that he was tired of being polite. Rage and sheer determination gave him a burst of energy, and he hefted George up one more time and trooped downstairs to confront the creature that was trying to scare him away. \"I'm down here, you've got to come quickly!\" a woman's voice said. He raced the rest of the way down the stairs, doing his best not to take a massive spill. As he approached the end of the corridor, his vision filled with a dreadful sight. There, between the two cells, a tug-of-war was taking place. The upper half of Mother Florence's daughter's body looked like it had been stretched by a team of sturdy horses, but it had lost its ability to block light, as if the integrity of the girl's body itself had been compromised. Roger dashed forward to grab onto the girl's hands and try and pull back. In the cell across from Mother Florence, the mannequin stood with its burlap fingers wrapped tight around the iron bars, its haypin mouth slack and drooling with a primitive hunger. Out from its mouth came a murky beam of light that seemed to encapsulate the unfortunate girl, who by now had thinned and stretched to the point of fitting through the bars of her own cell, and extending further and further towards the gaping maw of her attacker. Florence herself was holding tight to one leg, and her son Hector had his tiny fists wrapped around the other, but it didn't take long to surmise that they were losing the battle. Roger's own efforts were doing little to improve the situation. George lay in a pathetic heap on the concrete floor, arms akimbo, and black despair began to creep in. Roger had put up with far too much to give up at this stage, but there never seemed to be a way to win.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 254 Do I even care about getting home anymore? What if George does die? What's there to go home to then? I've already lost a mom, why should I deserve to lose a baby brother as well... The anger that had begun to ebb and fade administered a fresh injection. He let go of Maisie's hands, which dropped limply towards the floor. In a burst of motion he ran across the few remaining feet separating him from the hideous dummy. Already seeing red, he reached through the bars of his cell and folded his hands around the thing's plastic throat, pressing his thumbs deep into the space where his Adam's apple should be. Despite the artificiality of his overall appearance, the windpipe beneath his fingers felt real, and Roger thought how this is what it probably would feel like to kill a person. Not only commit murder, Roger, a voice said. Commit the murder of a being wearing Georgie's skin. What is going on here? But he had no time for such hesitant, childish thoughts. This... this thing before him had to be taken apart, put down, laid to rest. He was through with the obstacles preventing him from saving his real brother. He crunched his thumbs down even harder, and felt something rubbery, yet lined with hard ridges like a windpipe, give way, punching downwards as though he was squeezing an unpeeled hard-boiled egg. The beam of light that had previously held such a firm grip on Maisie's body seemed to falter and weaken, eventually filtering down to a misty haze. Roger pressed down even harder, but there was no need - the creature's eyes had already gone lifeless (if it had ever been alive to begin with), and the strange tractor beam that had extended from its mouth was now no more than a memory.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 255 # In the blink of an eye, Maisie had returned to her normal size and was now standing inside the cell, clutching her mother's dress and weeping with great gusto. Hector looked self-conscious and afraid, as if desperate to comfort her but unsure how. Roger watched them for another moment before snapping out of his trance. He wrapped George in his arms once more and hauled him over to Mother Florence's cage. The doll that Roger had killed lay in a hopeless jumble of limbs in the opposite cell, and he resolved not to spare it another glance. \"Come here, son, you're safe for now,\" Mother Florence said in a warm voice. He propped George so his back was against the bars and hoped he wouldn't keel over on one side. \"Please, can you help him?\" Roger begged. \"I think he's dying.\" \"Now, now, child, there's no need to worry like that. Let me take a look at him.\" She gently pried Maisie's fingers from her dress, gently hushing her, then moved over to crouch beside George. She reached through the bars and shifted him around so he faced the stairs back from where we'd come from, and his head lolled on his neck as she did so. \"He's been bitten badly by that two-faced snake of a pet Vladimir keeps around here,\" she said, \"but something tells me she's no longer a threat.\" Mother Florence looked up at Roger with beautiful, knowing eyes, ones that showed mild surprise at him, as if she knew the brutal means with which he had brought about that creature's demise. [It's good she's gone. I suppose it's a blessing that she went quickly, although we all know she deserved to suffer... a protracted death might have given her the chance to warn Vladimir, however. You did well to nip that in the bud.] The same warm voice that\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 256 had spoken out loud to him a second earlier now filled his head, but Roger found the sensation extremely pleasant, like wrapping up in a down comforter on a snowy Saturday morning. She went on: \"I'll need to drain the venom from your brother now. You hold his feet. Maisie, Hector, you two come here and each grab one shoulder, there, like that.\" She showed them with her fingers what was needed, and Roger dutifully gripped both of George's ankles as instructed. \"Now, Roger, I need you to be brave, and don't let go of his legs under any circumstances! That goes for you too, my little ones.\" She gave them each a reassuring pat on the back. Then, her slender wrist extended between the bars once more to grasp George's bicep, which was red and throbbed like an overripe tomato, although the swelling did not seem quite so bad as before. She rolled up his shirtsleeve to get a good look at the twin fang marks, and pulled his arm into the cell just enough so that she could bend her head down, pressing her lips to the skin with enough pressure to form a seal. She began to pull with her mouth, cheeks flexing and puffing to draw out the toxins that were rapidly draining away any life force that might be left in him. Roger steadied my hands and tried to be brave. Her lips let go and she turned her head to one side before letting forth the stringiest, blackest-looking stream of spit that he'd ever seen in his life. It splattered on the floor like a fat kid doing a cannonball, spreading into the cracks of the stone floor with mercury-like viscosity. George's legs bucked like twin electric eels under his brother's unsuspecting hands, and he had to move quickly to avoid getting kicked in the face. \"Hold him tightly, Roger!\"\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 257 He redoubled his grip once George had stopped flailing. His chest hitched up hard, and low, racking coughs emitted from his throat. \"That... Henrietta put that inside him?\" \"Yes, and you're lucky that I was here to remove it properly. Listen carefully, Roger: he won't be cured, not completely, until you get him out of the Realm and back where he belongs - at home, with you and your father. Do that, and the trace amounts left in his system won't do any permanent damage. He won't have to get any further treatment from any doctor's in your world, either, if that's what you're thinking, but it is crucial that you both escape this place. Do you understand?\" He nodded, then asked: \"But how do I find the return portal? There's no way we're going to make it back without some more help from the brothers.\" \"Then go to them you must,\" she said gravely. \"There is little time. I sense that the final battle is already at hand.\" \"But Vladimir will murder us!\" he groaned, already fearing that he would not be able to do as she said. To this she did not reply, only clutching her little ones closer to the hem of her garment. The ruffles of her dress outlined their cheeks in such an angelic way that he almost wished he could just stay with her, and bathe in the sense of security she gave off. \"Go now, child, the hour grows late,\" she said, gesturing with a shoo-ing motion. \"Leave your brother here with me. All will be well if you can be brave a little longer.\"  \"How will you escape?\" he asked. \"If you manage to vanquish Vladimir, all the evil manacles of the Realm that he has created will crumble, and the spell will be no more. I'll walk out of this basement free as a bird, with my children,\" she replied. His mind boggled at the thought that\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 258 they'd been tasked with vanquishing someone as obviously powerful as the evil king himself, but her mention of freedom did something to set his spirit alight. He understood the last task at hand, and felt ready to complete it. He shouldered that heavy load in his mind and proceeded to head up the stairs. He did not look back. Nothing could have prepared him for what he was about to witness in the great dining hall.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 259               CHAPTER 26  In their haste to get to the dining room and confront the grim king, Isaac and Daniel bumped into their brother Cassius, who was standing stock-still just inside the room, frozen by the old man before him. No longer sitting in wait, Vladimir had elected to stand at the ready - a wise decision on his part. The brothers meant business. Their scythes gleamed, and the shine in their eyes expressed a bitter longing for violence and confrontation. Vladimir slid the old saber out from its scabbard, where it reflected the light in a different, murkier way than the brothers' weapons of choice. \"I suppose you feel I'm beginning to lose my grip on this land we call home,\" Vladimir said, pronouncing each word like it might be his last. \"We could settle this like gentlemen. Leave the children to me, and I'll see that you live to be very rich men. I could give you a position of great power, each one of you. Think it over.\" \"No, you think it over, old man,\" Cassius said with a leer. His momentary shock at finding Vladimir ready to do battle had already faded. He has reasserted his fighting stance. \"Yes, enough prattling,\" Isaac said.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 260 \"You brought this upon yourself,\" Daniel added.  \"Well, if we can't work this out like reasonable adults, I suppose you leave me with no choice but to defend myself,\" Vladimir replied with an air of weariness, as if he had dispatched many an insurrectionist over the years. They were not his first, to be certain. The fighters approached one another. Vladimir assumed a fencer's graceful pose: right leg bent and leading, left leg cocked and to the side. The saber's deadly tip led forward into the fray. Daniel and Vladimir clashed together like two great stags locking horns. Cassius and Isaac hung back for a moment so as not to wound Daniel. Sword met scythe with a hefty clang that reverberated around the chamber, sending a shower of sparks down on the cobblestone floor. Cassius and Isaac glanced at each other, hesitant to join the battle lest they do more damage than good. Vladimir brought his sword back and swung again, then again. Daniel parried the blows, handily at first, but with each successive strike, Vladimir pushed him back two steps. His brothers retreated as well, and the space between their backs and the wall was rapidly running out. Sparing one final glance and a nod between themselves, Isaac and Cassius charged in to help Daniel. At that very moment, Roger appeared in the doorway.  # There was something both wonderful and terrifying about the array of fighters Roger found standing before him in that great hall of Vladimir's. He moved through the arched doorway into the room as though in a dream. A warm glow emanated from the hearth. The battle raged.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 261 Vladimir had the brothers pinned with their backs almost right up against the far wall, away from the fireplace. He brought down his sword again and again with a staggering amount of force for a person of such an elderly appearance. It's all they can do to keep their heads from getting chopped off, Roger realized with horror as he watched the brothers trying to defend themselves. Vladimir appeared to be attacking all three of them with equal effectiveness, and  their collective spirit seemed to be waning. In spite of their size and brute strength and dexterity. There was just no way they could stand up to that barrage for long. With yet another flurry of blows, Vladimir lashed out with a piercing lunge that managed to catch Daniel in the ribs. Roger watched, helpless, as the blade whicked through layers of leather armor and skin, causing a deep wound that would have been mortal two inches to the right. Daniel dropped his scythe and stumbled desperately out of the way, clutching the dripping, ragged tatters of his shirt. Blood flowed freely through his fingers as he staggered about like a wild beast whose flank had been sliced open by a tiger's claw. Roger opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. Instead, a voice filled his head, an old familiar one that rose like a calm oasis in the midst of a terrible storm. [Don't panic, Roger, don't lose your head. The time is at hand, we can end this. Look to your left.] He did as Percy's voice commanded. There beside the fireplace he saw a thin rope attached to a sturdy wooden fixture angling out across the floor of the hall. He followed the line with his eyes, up to the ceiling. Roger now understood that the fire in the hearth wasn't the only source of light in the room, and he wondered how he hadn't noticed it before: above the fighters there\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 262 hung a massive chandelier, glowing with what looked like a hundred lit candles, posted in an intricate design of wooden beams and struts cobbled together by some ancient hand. It must have weighed a ton. [Percy, what is going on? What are we going to do?] [Patience, young one. I'm going over to that rope. You get his attention, and bring him into position. Do you understand what I'm saying?] He did. To Roger's astonishment, a small, flat stone suddenly rolled over to one side  revealing a small opening, out of which promptly stepped Percy. His jaw dropped open. For a moment he had forgotten all about the battle happening twenty feet away, and was flooded with relief to see that his old traveling companion had come to no harm. To their right, the foursome had now been reduced to a trio of dueling warriors. Vladimir still possessed the upper hand. Daniel was now on his knees, staring down at his ribs and probing the wound with his fingers. Roger suddenly had to fight the urge to gag. Everything was happening far too quickly, and the sight of blood beginning to pool on the floor made his head spin. That was when Daniel tottered, reached out with one hand like a blind man seeking guidance, then collapsed directly onto his side with a mighty thud. His head made a sickening crunch as it connected with the cobblestone floor. He lay still. His brothers almost stopped fighting for a moment, but knew they would lose their lives if they stopped to help their fallen brother. A cold fact made worse by Vladimir's cold indifference. Roger stared at Daniel's enormous fallen body, pleading in his head for some sign of life, but of course there was none. [We're out of time, George is going to die!]\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 263 Percy scampered over to the rope and fastened his beak around the line. He started grinding his ridges back and forth, using them like a four-bladed saw to attack the tough material from above and below simultaneously. Roger could just hear the faint, buzzy scratching sound it made, masked by the crackling logs. To his amazement, the rope began to fray. It twitched under Percy's beak like a gently plucked guitar string, and he could see the almost-imperceptible movements of the wooden chandelier. The battle in the middle of the room appeared to be nearing an end, and the outcome wasn't going to be favorable for the forces of good unless something turned around in a hurry. Vladimir still hasn't noticed me, how can that even be possible? Roger thought. He remembered that Percy had given him an order, and now was the time to fulfill it. He had to get their attention and get Vladimir under the chandelier, otherwise the whole cursed adventure was going to end in the most abject failure imaginable; George would die, and Vladimir would likely drain Roger's blood himself to feed that infernal machine he kept in his basement. He finally sprang into action. \"Hey, hey, over here, Vladimir!\" he cried, waving his arms simultaneously. It seemed like the most basic approach would be the effective one. \"Look over here, you bully, why don't you leave us alone already!\" Never one to lose an advantage in a fight, Vladimir maintained his concentration long enough to swing a fearsome blow that forced both the remaining brothers to raise their scythes in desperate self-defense. The saber came crashing down on their heads. The force was enough to scatter them backwards, and they crashed into the chairs around the dining table. Their huge bodies slammed into the furniture and collapsed in a pile of limbs. Their scythes clanked to the floor, and Cassius and Isaac looked too\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 264 stunned to move. The king looked confident that he had them under control for the time being. Vladimir Cruor turned his attention to Roger.  # \"So you're the one I've been looking for all this time,\" Vladimir said, his voice eerily calm. \"You made quite the journey to get here. You must love your brother very much.\" Roger instinctively took a step backwards. Vladimir crept toward him with cat-like slyness, as though preparing to pounce. His eyes had a kind of glaze over them, like one you might expect to see on a fresh corpse. Roger thought he could smell the rot on his breath as he advanced, shuffling like a mummy bent on exacting revenge for its tomb having been violated. Vladimir lowered the longsword to his side, though it still gleamed with its dull lethality as before; now, however, it was slick with Daniel's blood. Roger spared a glance in the wounded Grimsrud's direction, and his heart sank to see that he still showed no signs of movement. Roger felt an absence in the air, too, as though a crucial piece of energy had departed the universe for good. [Something tells me Daniel's no longer with us,] he thought to Percy, hoping he'd catch the warning in time. Cassius and Isaac were still trying to extract themselves from the pile of chairs, and Vladimir was rapidly gaining ground on the boy. \"I do love my brother, and you can't have him!\" Roger said with as much grit as he could muster. Vladimir looked taken aback. \"What did you say?\" This time Roger took a step forward, ignoring the rotten stench in the air.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 265 \"I said, he's my brother, and I'm taking him home. If I were you, Vladimir Cruor, I'd put that rusty old sword down and just fuck off.\"The shocked expression grew more pronounced. Roger had managed to catch him off-guard.   Vladimir now stood directly beneath the chandelier. Roger didn't dare throw a single glance back at Percy out of fear that Vladimir would follow his gaze and notice him instantly, but even still, beneath all the commotion of that great dining hall, he could hear the persistent gnawing that signaled Percy still had not managed to sever the rope. Please let this work, Roger prayed. \"Bold words, spoken in a strange tongue,\" Vladimir said with a puzzled look on his face. He kept advancing with the sword. \"Regardless, I'm afraid it's time for you to die.\" \"Percy, bite that thing in half, for crying out loud!\" Roger yelled at the top of my lungs. He unconsciously took a half step backward and bumped into the corner of the huge dining table. At that very moment, a sharp, rubber-band twang met my ears. They both looked up, and there it was, the plan in motion. The incomprehensible weight of the massive chandelier made the line whistle as it flickered through the large eye-screw that had previously held it aloft. For one panicked instant Roger thought it would miss him. Vladimir had just enough time to lower his gaze, and in his eyes Roger saw a strange kind of confusion. He seemed to realize his own defeat, and was completely perplexed by it.  The thick wooden fixture crashed down upon his head with terrifying momentum. There was a sharp crack as his skull hit the floor and more or less exploded, and his body slammed down with a sickening crunch. In spite of the rapid descent, several of\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 266 the candles that made up the chandelier still flickered brightly in the relative gloom of the dining hall. [Holy shit. Percy did you see that?] Vladimir twitched, and then from his mouth came a moan that sounded like a lonesome prairie wolf. Roger looked a bit closer, and saw blood trailing out of his left ear. [Is he still alive?] [I think it's safe to say he's on his way out, son.] Percy came out from his hiding place over by the hearth and walked over to join him. Cassius and Isaac had finally pulled themselves together, and moved over to look at the body as well. Roger looked up at them with red eyes. It felt like days since he had slept. Time had lost all meaning on the other side, and he wondered if anything would ever be the same after all that had happened. He thought of George, sitting down there in the dungeon with only Mother Florence and her children for company, when what he really needed to see was a familiar face. \"Aren't you going to check on Daniel?\" he asked, the overwhelming exhaustion reflected fully in his voice. They shook their heads in unison. \"He's gone now, Roger,\" Cassius said. \"He died valiantly, fighting for what he believed in, and I think that because of his actions, we may be able to get you and your brother home safely.\" \"The truth is,\" Isaac went on, \"you two saved us. Your friend there deserves to be called a hero.\" He motioned to Percy, whose chest swelled with pride.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 267 \"I don't need any praise, gentlemen. That man had plagued our land for far too long. I... in fact, I don't even know what to say right now. I can't believe he's gone.\" It appeared to be true. Vladimir's body lay still, and something strange and terrible began to happen: tiny sprigs of wheat began to emerge from all over his corpse, forming in isolated patches at first, then expanding to cover his entire body before it finally burst through the ragged clothing that remained, causing it to rot and fall away. More sand-colored stalks burst forth from his mouth like a foamy tide, and his eyes seemed to dissolve into some kind of clear, viscous jelly, through which yet more blades of the tawny grass started to grow. They seemed never-ending. The survivors looked on in fascination. Percy did not utter a sound, either out loud or in his mind. But the transformation still was not finished, even as it enveloped Vladimir's corpse from head to toe. The amber colored plant, continued to lengthen and blossom, with fluttery, oat-like heads that Roger imagined would have felt fuzzy and ticklish to the touch. It also drooped and scratched along the stone floor. The chandelier was also displaying the effects of this sudden infusion of plant matter, with the substance pulsing and thrusting through the various gaps in the wooden framework of the lighting fixture. He saw that before long, the stalks would ignite in a fiery blaze. The sweeping growth of the barley traversed the floor until it reached Daniel, then commenced the exact same process that had already more or less consumed Vladimir's entire body; Roger could hardly recognize any part of what had only moments ago been an imposing man wielding a sword. At this point, he felt relief coursing through my veins, a sort of electrical charge that bounced from ear to ear, back and forth in his skull.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 268 The strange blades of grass covered Daniel's entire body as it had Vladimir's, and then all was still. Roger heard a sniff, and saw that an enormous tear was rolling down Cassius's left cheek. It disappeared into the bushy black growth of his beard as if it had never existed. He dragged the hairy backside of one oversized hand across his cheek, and with that, the moment belonged to the past forever more. Isaac showed no emotion whatsoever, standing stock-still with his scythe gripped firmly in one hand. He looked like he never wanted to put it down again.  \"Well, he wouldn't have wanted to delay us. At least this way we don't have to bury him right away,\" Isaac said in a gruff voice. \"Now, or ever,\" Cassius replied in a voice devoid of emotion. \"I think we can all agree that there is one final, important matter at hand,\" Percy suddenly chimed in, his voice resonating with a strange sort of confidence that Roger hadn't heard since they'd first met. Perhaps it was because they had been conversing primarily in our heads for the past hour or so, but something had changed in the bird; he was not the same creature as the one with whom Roger entered that series of challenges in the train. That seemed like a millennium ago. \"We need to retrieve this young man's brother from downstairs, and make sure they both make it to the return portal. I don't think I need to remind you that time is of the essence.\" The brothers muttered in agreement, and before Roger knew it, they had left the bodies of Vladimir and Daniel behind, trooping off single-file out of the dining hall the same way they had come in. Roger spared a single glance back, and saw that the grass was still moving, albeit it very slowly. The only trace of the two bodies that remained in that room was now a pair of enormous lumps, one considerably more bulky than the other given the size of that wooden chandelier.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 269 They marched down the hall. Cassius led the pack, scythe in hand. Isaac kept his head down, eyes trained on his boots. They made their way down the steps and into the dungeon. George sat with his back propped against the bars as before, only now Mother Florence and her children were miraculously standing outside their cell. She was crouched beside George with one hand placed reassuringly on his back, while Maisie and Hector stood by her side, twin expressions of worry on their tiny faces. She turned to greet the crew as they came down the hallway. \"Oh, you brave men, you've done it!\" she said. \"He's really gone, isn't he?\" \"Not just gone - the Realm seems to have reclaimed him,\" Cassius said. Mother Florence gave him a knowing look. \"Yes, I had expected as much. What little remains there are will be gone by tomorrow. You did well, brothers,\" she said, \"and you too, Roger. I heard the tremendous crash that must have ended it - your handiwork?\" She sounded impressed. \"Mine and Percy's,\" he replied. \"It was his idea.\"  Compassion and gratitude shone in her eyes as she lowered her gaze to Percy, who stood faithfully by my side. \"Even the smallest friends can possess the heart of a lion. You may have saved us all, you know. Thank you.\" \"I did what I had to, Mother Florence, nothing more and nothing less,\" he said in a humble voice. He sounded even wearier than Roger, which was saying something. Roger wondered if Percy might not have been wounded in the fray, but aside from the fact that he seemed to have aged about a dozen years, he didn't appear to be in any physical pain. Roger reminded himself not to get worked up, and that the worst of the danger was now behind them.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 270 \"You deserve to be rewarded, comrade,\" Florence said. \"Come here. I think I know just the thing.\" Percy obediently trudged over until he was standing beside her, next to George's place on the floor. George still gave no signs of movement, although Roger could just make out the soft rise and fall of his chest, and a thin whisper of breath rattled between his lips. They needed to get him out of the Realm and back home. \"Don't worry, Roger, this'll only take a moment,\" she said, as though reading his thoughts. Without another word, she gathered Percy into her arms, caressing his glistening black feathers with one hand while cradling him in the other. He looked like a strange baby bird that had been delivered to a human mother by mistake. \"How long have you lived with this broken wing?\" she asked in a soothing tone. \"Longer than I can remember,\" his voice sounded dreamy, far away. His eyes were trained on her face with a look of sleepy wonder. \"Vladimir took that away from me, and I've had to ride that dingy train to get around ever since.\" \"The spell shall be broken, my dear.\" With that, she traced her index finger along the bone in his wing that had been crooked for heaven only knew how long. To Roger's amazement, the injured appendage suddenly began to straighten. Her finger plotted a delicate course along the entire length of Percy's wing, and by the time it reached the very tip, the bone had become like new again, right before their very eyes. Roger's mouth hung open in astonishment. \"How did you do that?\" he blurted out. Mother Florence made no answer, only pressing that same finger she had used on Percy to her lips for silence. Percy looked stunned, but otherwise all right. She placed him on the ground with the same care that she had probably set her own children down\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 271 thousands of times, and he weaved for a brief instant before regaining his balance. Cassius, Isaac, and Roger all watched with fascination. \"I... I feel like a teenager again,\" Percy finally said. He flexed the new wing, testing it, then checked the other just to be sure that one was in order, too. \"Percy, there isn't much time. Go now, help get them to the exit tree or they'll be trapped here forever. The portal will close soon - you must hurry!\" She started to try and pick George up to hand him off to Cassius, but he was still slumped back like a sack of potatoes, and when she let go of his neck, his head lolled about like a rag doll. Cassius hurried over to help, scooping him up and plopping him on his shoulders with ease. At least some color was returning to his cheeks, and the swelling had all but disappeared from the bite that Henrietta had delivered earlier. As Cassius took George up on his shoulders, a small miracle happened: George yawned. It was a big, sleepy gulp of air that brought all the humanity rushing back into him in an instant, and Roger immediately felt gladdened. Looks like things might turn out okay after all. \"Let's make haste gentlemen, these boys have been away from their family for too long, and I want to do something that I've been waiting to try again for ages,\" Percy said, with a note of anxiety, as if Mother Florence's magic might wear off at any moment. \"You'll be safe on your own?\" Isaac asked Mother Florence in a gruff voice that might have been affection, or possibly mild attraction. \"Yes, I imagine we'll be home by midnight at this rate. I know a little trick that should put my campsite back together nicely, and there shan't be any threats on the open plains now that Vladimir has left us. We'd do well to hurry, though. You've done\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 272 more than you can possibly know, and I'll never be able to thank you enough. Get these boys home, and carry my blessing with you,\" she said, beaming. There was no more time to waste. The five of them trundled up the stairs, leaving Mother Florence and her brood behind in the Realm, perhaps forever. Hector and Maisie waved goodbye in identical fashion as Roger walked up the stairs. Then they disappeared from view, and the men were on our way.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 273               CHAPTER 27  As they finally exited the house, the cold night air struck Roger in a cool and refreshing wave. Everything around him drew into sharp focus, a relief after the dim lighting of the house had made everything seem so blurry before. They found themselves standing in the courtyard, that strange red border now gone, and Roger's eyes traced the moonlit fence to a gap that would allow them to leave the grounds. He wondered if Cassius and Isaac would go back into the dining hall to see if they could preserve any part of their brother's body for a more fitting funeral, but I realized I already knew the answer to that question. The wheat had consumed him and Vladimir Cruor like a fast-rising tide that covered deformities in the beach sand as though there had never been anything there at all. \"This way,\" Cassius said. They followed in his tread as he marched towards the gap in the fence, and the haggard forest that lay beyond it. From this distance, the trees looked like spindly matchsticks that some giant had decided to stick in the ground as a trap. Roger tried to make out George in the moonlight, bobbing along ahead of him on Cassius's shoulder,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 274 hoping to see some other signs of life, but in the darkness he couldn't tell. That yawn had given him all the hope and confidence he needed, however, and he marched onward through the night with a sure step. \"Not much farther now,\" Cassius murmured. The mood was somber. They crossed what Roger guessed was the outer edge of a forest, walking now amongst the trees. \"Cassius, what will happen to that machine now that Vladimir is dead?\" Roger asked. He doubted this was an appropriate time to pose such a question, but if he didn't ask now, he'd probably never have another chance. \"The parts will rust and deteriorate with no fuel and no one to care for it,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"You boys were Vladimir's last-ditch effort to save his kingdom, and his own hide - you do know that, don't you?\" It hadn't really occurred to him to put it in those terms, but he understood well enough what he meant. \"In fact, I imagine that same rogue plant matter we saw rising up out of old Vladimir is slowly working its way over that infernal contraption as well. Henrietta's probably turned to dust - at least, if the stories are true, she will have - and that poor fool Mandrake, who stood about a matchstick's chance in a prairie twister of getting out of this alive, will melt into the floorboards like a spilt glass of water. That about answer your questions, son?\" It did. Roger thought back on all he'd been through, and for a brief instant he felt an urge to stay. But no, George needed him, and their father surely was in total panic at their disappearance. They had to get back.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 275 The forest floor began to incline gently upward, and at the exact moment that Roger noticed the slope, his skin suddenly felt hot and prickly, as though they had entered a low-energy force field that caused a charge to react to his skin. To his astonishment, George lifted his head, blinking, and began to look around. Roger immediately saw recognition in his eyes and knew everything he needed to know.      \"George, you're alive, we made it!\" he cried, his face already spreading into a smile from ear-to-ear. Roger dashed forward to catch up with Cassius, although he knew he wouldn't be able to put him down just then; Georgie probably wouldn't have been able to walk under his own power at that point, anyway. Nevertheless, I walked in stride with Cassius, gazing up at my brother, who stared back, still draped loosely over the giant's right shoulder.      \"Roger ... ?\" he murmured. \"Did we make it?\"      \"We sure did! Boy, am I glad to see you.\"      \"Is this ... Maine?\"      \"Not exactly, bud. We're a long way from home, but we're going to be back there in just a few minutes, safe and snug in our beds where we belong.\"      \"I ... don't remember what happened,\" he said, his reply punctuated by another one of those great yawns that instantly filled my heart with even more cheer.      \"That's all right, it'll come back to you. Oh, George, it was incredible! I jumped on a train and met this talking bird, he's right back there, his name's Percy, and we rode the rails until we realized that we'd need to go see Mother Florence to figure out how to get you back - she's the one who helped us out back in the dungeon, although I suppose you don't remember much of that either - and there was a huge battle with Vladimir Cruor, the guy who kidnapped you in the first place - well, he had some help,\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 276 too, but I think everything's all right now, you don't have anything left to worry about!\" I paused to take a breath, and realized that little of this would mean anything to him under the present circumstances. I was just so glad that he was alive, and above all else that he had recognized me. It hadn't occurred to me at the time, but I was frightened to death that Henrietta's poison, Vladimir's brainwashing, or both had caused him to lose his memory, and perhaps his identity. The fact that Georgie was all in one piece, both physically and mentally, put the icing on the cake. We were home free. Right at that moment, Cassius stopped walking; we were standing directly before a massive, dead, gnarl-limbed tree. In the center, familiar as an old friend with whom you had weathered some serious trouble, I saw that glowing blue crystal light that had brought us here in the first place - and would bring us back home again. # \"Well, step right up. This here's the easy part,\" Cassius said. He sounded like he wanted to get home himself - that, and sleep for about 14 hours. \"This is where we must leave you,\" Isaac said from behind Roger. He placed a steady hand on his shoulder. \"Everything you have done here was done for good. You have saved this place from a great deal more heartache that was to come.\" [There might be one creature that can. I think you're right about the brothers though, their whole lives are here.] Percy. His voice blinked on in Roger's head like a traffic signal, and he realized how much he would miss their silent conversations. The idea formed as quickly as that. [You could come?] Roger asked in disbelief, hardly daring to believe it might be possible. He liked having him around.\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 277 [I've grown tired of this place, and I need a fresh beginning. You go through, holding George in your arms of course so he doesn't hurt himself, and I'll be in right behind you.] [What about your first flight?] Roger asked, suddenly remembering that Mother Florence had told him he could try it out as soon as he got out into the clean night air. [I want it to be over there,] he said. \"What are you standing around for?\" Cassius asked. He was already unloading George from his shoulders, preparing to hand him over to Roger so they could make the jump together. He began to grow nervous, and a mild sweat broke out on his neck and forehead. George felt far too light for a boy of his age, and he gathered him up in his arms, just as Mother Florence had done with Percy. He spared one last backwards glance at his companion, and prayed that he would make it through in one piece. There had been enough close calls for one day. He stepped up to the rim of the great, dead oak, turned around, and sat on the lip so that he was now facing outwards to look at Cassius, Isaac, and Percy, who were standing on top of the roots to his left. Percy looked incredibly nervous in spite of himself. \"This is it, then,\" he said with a sigh, not really knowing if there was anything else to say. \"Goodbye.\" Like a scuba diver, Roger tipped over backwards into the tree, and just like that they were gone. # Impossibly bright morning sunshine blasted him in the face, and everything else that he could see appeared to be awash in the most brilliant green he had ever seen. There was\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 278 nothing to compare it to - they had gone from the full dark of midnight in the Realm to the blazing colors and heat of a July morning in New England, and Roger's heart immediately pumped itself full to the brim with joy and adrenaline. They were back. He almost started to look around in frantic search of George, when he realized his brother was still clutched tightly in his arms. Everything had gone off without a hitch, and as if to confirm that conclusion, a squawky voice piped up from below. \"Well, that beats having to ride the train everywhere you go, doesn't it?\" Percy strutted about, apparently taking in the details of his new environment with a sublime enjoyment that Roger could only try to imagine. Roger was thrilled to be back, and glad that Percy was here too, but there was something else he wanted to see. \"Take a test flight, Percy, you've been waiting forever, you said so yourself.\" He stopped prancing around and looked at Roger. \"I suppose I can't put it off forever. I'm a bundle of nerves though, what if it doesn't work?\" he asked, his voice quavering with trepidation. \"Then we'll take care of you, and make sure no harm comes to you. What could go wrong now? One way or the other, you're safe here with us.\" \"I'd be safe in the Realm too with Vladimir out of the way, that's not what I'm worried about... but oh well, it's now or never, isn't it? Here I go.\" Without another second of hesitation, Percy went for it. Roger and George watched him spring into the air, beating his wings like his life depended on it. In seconds he caught a gust that sent him soaring about a hundred feet in the air. George, who was now standing and laughing beside Roger like nothing at all had happened, whooped and cheered as the raven twirled higher and higher, then came back around to\nVary / \"THE CRIMSON HARVESTER\" / 279 make a bombing run, diving straight down towards the earth before pulling up right before the boys' delighted faces at what seemed like the last possible second. Roger joined George, laughing and yelling in what felt like the first time in weeks. It felt great to be a kid again.  THE END"}

MEXICAN SUBURB - MORNING\nAerial shot of a sprawling, sun-soaked Mexican neighborhood. Three boys race each other along stone-paved paths leading to a cul-de-sac of upscale homes.\nSUPER: Durango, Mexico, 1941.\nEach young man carries a cloth drawstring bag. Their names are ANTHONY ACEVEDO, JOSE BLANCO, and MIGUEL COROLLA, all aged 16.\nThey make their way to a side alley, shaded and creeping with hyacinth vines. They arrive at an ornate iron gate built into a high stone wall.\nAnthony withdraws a brass key from his bag and unlocks the gate. All three step inside to reveal...\nEXT. THE ACEVEDO POOL - DAY\n..a sparkling blue swimming pool on Anthony's private property. The guys strip off clothes to reveal athletic physiques, and retrieve goggles from their gym bags.\nJose playfully shoves Anthony out of the way and swan dives into the deep end. ANTHONY and MIGUEL follow suit, hopping in the water between red and blue plastic lane dividers, prepping for the day's workout.\nAnthony paddles over to a speaker-like gadget mounted on the lip of the pool near a ladder. He flips a switch and perfectly clear music reverberates through the water.\nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY\nMusic plays and intersperses in a montage of the swimmers surging along in their lanes. The melody has a clean, brittle quality when played underwater.\nEXT. POOL DECK - DAY\nThey finish their workout and towel off.\nJOSE(in Spanish)I had the jump on you today, Anthony.\n2.\nANTHONYUh huh, whatever you say. I was saving my energy.\nMIGUELCome on, we gotta go. Mrs. Gonzales is going to tan our hides if we're late again.\nThey head into a small building off to one side of the pool compound.\nINT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY\nThe boys ascend a staircase and head down a finely decorated hallway towards a locker room.\nThere is one door along the hall, which appears to be open a crack. A sliver of light and voices emanate from within.\nINT. STUDY - DAY\nSeated at the large writing desk is Anthony's father, FRANCISCO, 50. He is a grave looking man with a gray beard and mustache, dressed in casual work clothes. TWO MEN partially obscure him from view, as they are standing in front of the desk with their backs to the door.\nAnthony stops at the crack in the door as the other boys hurry past him to change.\nThe two young men speak with FRANCISCO in hushed tones, their accents sounding faintly German. Something silver gleams on the desk between them. A Browning automatic RIFLE. Francisco turns it over, inspecting it. He seems to be explaining something to them.\nHe pops out a large box clip - empty.\nFrancisco's fingertips are black with smudges of gun grease. He handles the gun tenderly, with learned care.\nAnthony notices a stack of paper money on the desk.\nThe boy slips away from the door before his father can see him. He runs off down the hall to find his friends in the locker room.\nThe men inside the office hear the slight sound and glance toward the gap in the doorway, but Anthony is long gone.\n2.\n3.\nEXT. FOREST - DAY\nTITLE CARD:\n3 years later...\nDECEMBER, 1944. ARDENNES FOREST. The Allies have pushed the German army to the brink of defeat, but Hitler mounts a final, massive counter-offensive designed to break the Allies' backs in the West. The U.S. would sustain its heaviest casualties of the war.\n(Text Fade In:) This became known as the Battle of the Bulge.\nSounds of an army on the move fade in - gruff voices, pots, weapons, and gear all clanking together. We are looking at the young adult face of ANTHONY, his features sharp and refined.\nThe sun throws a heavy glare off the endless snow that surrounds them.\nEXT. FOREST - DAY\nSuper: Somewhere near Phillipsburg, Germany, on the border with Belgium...\nA large column of AMERICAN INFANTRY marches along a woodland trail. The sounds of artillery and aircraft echo in the distance. Not close, but not terribly far either.\nAnthony seems to be carrying more gear than anyone else, and he is further distinguished by the Red Cross band on his arm. He's got a large backpack on, a carbine dangling off his other shoulder from its leather strap, and every pocket on his uniform looks full.\nA few paces behind him is his buddy, NORM FELLMAN, a 20-year-old scout/rifleman from Norfolk, Virginia.\nNORMTony, it never ceases to amaze me how much bullshit you carry into battle.\nANTHONY(slightly winded)And how do you know that one extra thing I brought isn't going to save your life?\n3.\n4.\nNORMHow do I know you're not going to stick your head in a snowbank and need twenty guys to dislodge you while I'm bleeding out?\nANTHONYYou know Norm, I feel like the odds of that happening are pretty low.\nNorm kicks at a snowdrift. The wire fences of their FIELD HEADQUARTERS come into view. The men wear patches depicting an AXE and a FIR TREE, indicating that they are members of the U.S. Army's 70th infantry division.\nA soldier behind them bounces a pinecone off Anthony's helmet. It is MURRAY PRUZAN, also a medic, and a close friend.\nMURRAYHey, how long we got before we get back to the factory? My last remaining nut just froze off.\nAnthony pulls a grimace.\nANTHONYI don't think I have anything in my kit for that, Murray.\nNORMI'm going to pour two tins of beef stew straight down my throat. I don't care what they put in it anymore, as long as it's hot.\nANTHONYYou do that Norm, and everyone get some rest. Captain says we're out on a long patrol again tomorrow.\nMURRAYLong patrol my ass. We're short on everything. Do you have any extra morphine?\nANTHONYNo, I don't, and if you see any you should give it to me first. I'm the ranking medical officer around here and I'll divvy up the goods.\n4.\n5.\nMURRAY\"Extra morphine reserved for personal use by Private Acevedo\", got it.\nMurray spits in the snow.\nMURRAY(CONT'D)Damn, they better be able to dig up some more cold weather gear before we go out again. I saw a couple guys putting on boots with no socks, I shit you not.\nAnthony's face instantly grows concerned. Nothing he can do about it at the moment, however.\nThe men keep march into the bivouac. The day is settling into dusk, and orange ribbons of dying sunlight stream through the skeletal branches of the woods. Crows stare at the troops with beady eyes.\nThe wind howls through the trees.\nEXT. WIRE FACTORY - DUSK\nThe men stamp across muddy tracks left by massive vehicles, past the perimeter fencing and tank traps strewn with barbed wire. A lone sentinel stands by the entrance.\nA platoon of captured GERMAN TROOPS stands off to one side of a huge industrial warehouse. They mill about uncertainly as an American officer and a commando holding a Thompson submachine gun seem to haggle over the fate of the prisoners.\nThe officer hands the commando a pack of cigarettes, and leaves him to take care of the prisoners.\nThe commando begins to usher the Germans around the corner of the warehouse, out of sight.\nAnthony stands watching all this intently, his eyes black and shiny with anger. One departing prisoner briefly makes eye contact with Anthony, giving him a suppressed, hopeless grin, as if to say, well, war is hell, what can ya do?\nANTHONYThey can't possibly be serious.\nNorm and Murray pull up next to him, their heavy flak jackets now open and their weapons at their side, and watch the Germans vanish one by one around the side of the building, shepherded by the stone-faced lieutenant.\n5.\n6.\nNorm puts a hand on Anthony's shoulder. He doesn't have to hold him back, but that could change instantly.\nMurray takes off his helmet and runs his hands hard through his hair, his brow furrowed. Muted looks all around.\nThey are well within earshot when the thunderous chattering of the Thompson goes off a moment later.\nINT. BARRACKS TENT - NIGHT\nAnthony slumps over on his cot. The other guys come in and drop battle gear onto their cots, blowing on their hands, too tired to move beyond the bare minimum.\nA captain lifts aside the tent flap: HARRY MEYERS, 28. His cheeks show signs of windburn and no access to a good razor. Anthony rolls over and the fellas all stand to attention.\nMEYERSSettle in men, at ease. Long cold day out on the trail, I know, and another one tomorrow. I need you all up at dawn per usual for combat patrol.\nVisible looks of unease, a stifled groan somewhere in the back.\nMEYERS(CONT'D)Papers back home are already calling this the last great German offensive of the war, and the high command agrees with that assessment. This is all they've got left, and it ain't much. So just stand tall and play out the fourth quarter, all right gentlemen? There are some goddamn fine professional soldiers in this company and I have no doubt that you will continue to act like it, until Hitler gets strung up by the balls in Times Square.\nThe men chuckle, some cheer. Anthony does neither. He can see the grey walls of the warehouse in the inky darkness through the tent flap.\n6.\n7.\nMEYERS(CONT'D)That being said there's a hell of a lot of work that remains to be done. I expect you all to do your jobs. Questions?\nThere are none. Captain Meyers nods and exits.\nGuys prepare for sleep with their evening routines. Some read, write letters, or pray.\nAnthony curls up on his side and stares at the canvas wall of the tent, isolating himself from everyone. Fade out.\nINT. BARRACKS - MORNING\nAnthony blinks and stares at the ceiling. More canvas. He glances around and sees all his comrades still sleeping.\nSunlight streams in through the tent flap. He rolls out of bed and walks to the entrance, boots crunching on cold dirt. Brilliant blue sky floods the shot.\nA few puffy clouds dot the sky. It is a gorgeous day, warm too. Icicles drip from the trees, and birds sing.\nEXT. OUTSIDE THE TENT - DAY\nAnthony emerges into the muddy clearing surrounding the barracks, peering around at the rest of the base, blinking in the sunshine. It is a portrait of stillness. Why is no one else up?\nSomething suddenly catches his eye. A white flash of movement at one of the traffic barriers. It comes into focus. There is a deer by the perimeter.\nEXT. THE PERIMETER - DAY\nClose up of the DEER, then P.O.V. Of the animal looking back at Anthony inside the factory compound from a distance, the young medic partially obscured by barbed wire.\nEXT. TENT ENTRANCE - DAY\nAnthony leans forward, straining to get a better look at the deer. His attention is jerked away by the sound of boots hitting the mud at a frantic pace. The steps increase dramatically in volume as Anthony turns to reveal...\n7.\n8.\nA NAZI SOLDIER in full winter camouflage gear, CHARGING at Anthony with a bayonet at the end of his rifle. His face is a deranged mask of soot, gun grease, and rage.\nThe big Nazi sneers at him, revealing rotted yellow stumps for teeth.\nHe reaches the medic, who is too shocked to move. With no hesitation, the nightmare soldier DRIVES the rifle into Anthony's belly, then thrusts the bayonet upwards to break his sternum with a reverberating crunch.\nINT. BARRACKS - DAWN\nAnthony wakes with a gasp and sits straight up in his bunk. His brow and his sheets are wet with perspiration. The sun has not yet risen, but all around him other guys are getting up and preparing for patrol\nMurray happens to be nearby and places a reassuring hand on Anthony's shoulder.\nMURRAYWhoa, hey, easy buddy. That must have been some nightmare.\nANTHONYI'm fine, I'm up, I'm up.\nSounds of wood and steel clatter through the tent as guys check their rifles, load clips, and fasten grenades to their vests.\nAnthony chugs from a canteen of water. He looks more composed than a moment earlier.\nNorm waltzes back through the door, zipping up his fly.\nNORMWhat do you say, Tony, are we going to put the goddamn hurt on some Krauts today or what? I want to stir me up a real feisty patrol.\nMURRAYWhat in god's name got into you. The virgin Mary give you a hand job in your sleep?\nAnthony can't help but smile.\n8.\n9.\nNORMNot my type. Nope, just ready to get back out there, as it turns out.\nThey file out of the tent one by one. The sun and the snow envelop them and the soldiers dissolve into the blinding light.\nEXT. THE FOREST - DAY\nThe cool blue aura of the snow and the pale daylight wash over the green and brown uniforms. The men periodically plunge into snowdrifts that come up to their knees, if not higher.\nAnthony heaves himself over a fallen tree and lands in a shallow drift.\nThe column stretches out in front of and behind him, about 20 yards between each man.\nThe wind has started to whip up as well, sending harsh blasts of icy particles across the soldiers' faces. They try their best to cover their faces with makeshift scarves to defend against the repeated volleys of powder.\nAnthony sucks wind, trying to catch his breath and focus his eyes on the trail ahead at the same time.\nThey're walking along a treacherous looking ridge that slopes steeply down on the column's left flank.\nSuddenly Norm thumps into Anthony from behind.\nNORMWell? Are your thighs burning? Cause mine are. Charles Atlas'll have nothing on us once this hike is through, eh Tony?\nANTHONY(mildly disoriented)Ha.. Yeah Norm, anything you say.\nEXT. RIDGELINE - DAY\nThey march onward, precariously arranged on the ridge.\nWithout warning, MACHINE GUN FIRE opens up from somewhere far ahead of the column. Training kicks in and the men scatter as they look for cover.\n9.\n10.\nIt is controlled chaos as the Americans dig in and return fire. Some of the men tumble haphazardly down the sides of the ridge as they look for boulders, fallen tree limbs, any cover at all.\nAnthony grunts and hits the snow as TRACER ROUNDS zip by overhead. He catches sight of Norm and Murray as they stomp off into the brush to find fighting positions.\nMachine gun bullets spray the snow all around.\nMen are taking hits left and right. Some fall and lie still.\nBlooming flowers of blood begin to stain the snow.\nAnthony raises his head and attempts to survey the battlefield.\nHe looks down the slope of the ridge into the treeline and spots a cluster of friendlies. One member of the group lies dead on his back, his head split by a round. The dead soldier's comrades continue to take potshots at the origin of the tracers.\nAnother round punches through one of the fighter's shoulders, causing him to pinwheel and fall to the snow. He tries to raise his rifle to keep fighting, but his arm is totally useless. He roars out of pain and frustration.\nPRIVATE(screaming)MEDIC!!\nBullets continue to snap the air around Anthony's head, but he scrambles down the hill in the direction of the decimated foxhole crew.\nHe lurches forward, but loses balance under the weight of all his gear. He loses his footing on the steep side of the ridge and FLIES through the air, almost gracefully, in a slow-motion cartwheel, careening completely out of control down the hill.\nEXT. BASE OF RIDGE - DAY\nAnthony's gear is strewn about in the snow, his canteen slung awkwardly around his neck, his helmet perched at a jaunty angle.\nHe tries to gather himself up out of the deep snow. He looks around frantically for his weapon, then spots it. A carbine-like IMPRINT in the drift to his left.\n10.\n11.\nAnthony scrambles toward the shape.\nAt the spot where the gun should be, he digs his hands into the snow to pull it out. His fingers grasp freezing wood and metal.\nA branch snaps behind him.\nAnthony spins and stares, the image gradually drawing into focus.\nThere's a CAVE.\n30 yards away a squad of GERMAN SOLDIERS stares back at him from the entrance surrounded by pine trees. Their steel helmets make it like a mouth full of snails.\nINT. FROZEN CAVE - DAY\nThe German soldiers shout out in surprise. The enemies rack the bolts on their submachine guns and TAKE AIM at Anthony.\nEXT. TREELINE - DAY\nThe squad OPENS FIRE as Anthony bolts backwards up the ridge, grabbing onto tree roots and boulders.\nGunfire rips the world apart all around him.\nHe barrels up the hill, gasping for breath, miraculously untouched.\nEXT. HILLTOP - DAY\nThe battle is erupting from all directions now. Many of the American troops have managed to migrate from the terribly exposed ridge to the more easily defended hill that they now find themselves on. The snow is patchier here, and broken trees and yet more boulders provide cover.\nANTHONY scans the hilltop trench and finds NORM amongst the pockets of men. Norm is taking potshots at GERMANS that keep charging up from the bottom of the hill. A pair of them fall. More keep advancing as Norm fights to hold them off, leaping over the bodies of their fallen comrades.\nMURRAY is nowhere to be seen. Anthony hustles over to join Norm in the shallow foxhole he's been shooting from.\n11.\n12.\nNORM(between firing)How ya doin', buddy? They got us locked down pretty tight here.\nANTHONYWhere's Murray?\nNORMHe wasn't with you?\nNorm turns and finally gets a look at the snow-covered Anthony. He looks like Jack Frost after a rough night.\nThe two friends grin at each other, then both turn back to the fighting at hand.\nAmericans in foxholes dot the hilltop and part of the ridge, where the ambush first broke out. With the cacophony of small-arms fire, it sounds like the entire forest is spontaneously exploding.\nAn artillery shell shatters a tree not far from where Norm and Anthony have sheltered. Splinters the size of circus tent stakes RAIN DOWN on their helmets from on high.\nSuddenly Murray comes running like hell out of nowhere and CRASHES into the foxhole that Anthony and Norm are occupying.\nMURRAYHoly shit! You boys didn't count me out yet, did you?\nThey stare at him in disbelief and slowly shake their heads.\nMURRAY(CONT'D)Hey, would you look at that.\nThey all gaze at the shoulder of his uniform. The camera pans down to reveal that a huge tree splinter has gone clean through the fabric on the left side of his torso without leaving a scratch.\nMURRAY(CONT'D)Good thing they gave me two sizes too big, huh?\nThe shot broadens to reveal trenches, bodies, bloodstains, and fire sectors that the men have established as the defensive perimeter of the hilltop.\nGerman soldiers are now spilling from the treeline like the intestines of a stuffed animal that has split at the seams.\n12.\n13.\nThe Americans continue to fire, though clearly outnumbered.\nThe sun begins to set. The sound of gunfire fades as if receding in the distance. Soon all becomes still.\nEXT. THE HILLTOP - MORNING\nBERNARD \"JACK\" VOGEL, a lone scout, moves in a low crouch along a rough hewn path in the snow. The nest of surviving Americans is dug in somewhere in the distance behind him.\nHe stops, straining his ears. He puts a scoop of snow in his mouth to hide the icy plumes of his breath.\nA crow emits a lonesome CAW against the winter sky and takes off from a tree, causing Vogel to look up with a start.\nThat's when something catches his eye. It's a lump of gray cloth and the side of a steel HELMET protruding from the other side of a thick tree trunk.\nVogel blinks and rubs his eyes.\nA soldier is seated with his back against the opposite side of the tree, part of his side clearly visible.\nCamera pans to show a bit more of the soldier, as Vogel slowly walks toward him in a crouch, his M1 rifle at the ready.\nIn one smooth movement, he swivels around to face the body and points his rifle smartly - at the quite dead German corpse.\nVogel heaves a sigh of relief and lowers his weapon. He stares in awe at the corpse. A thin trickle of frozen blood has leaked out of the guy's mouth. His green eyes are wide open.\nVOGELBetter you than me, friend.\nHe reaches into the v-neck of his tunic and kisses a star of David pendant he has tucked away against his chest.\nA submachine gun lies next to the corpse's right hand.\nToo unnerved to investigate further, Vogel turns and sprints off in the direction from whence he came.\nThe dead German's eyes stare off into the deepening grey twilight of the winter woods.\n13.\n14.\nEXT. THE HILLTOP - NIGHT\nThe men are gathered around a very small campfire dug in a pit on the peak of the same old hill. Anthony has bandaged up more than a few guys and has done his best to attend to every survivor with the dwindling resources at his disposal.\nNorm tends to a small pot of BEANS bubbling over the coals, probably enough for about a mouthful per man, but that's better than nothing.\nNORMBeans and bullets. If we had an endless supply of those two things, this war would be over tomorrow.\nMURRAYNorm, the enemy would hear you coming from a mile away. I've heard those trumpet blasts you produce.\nNorm smiles wistfully.\nNORMLike Louis Armstrong takin' a solo...\nThe other grunts chuckle.\nMURRAYLike you, about to take something else.\nNORM(to Anthony)What do you think, doc? As the medical professional among us, that's just a sign of good health, ain't it?\nANTHONY(trying to keep a straight face)No, yeah, for sure, a strong sign of vitality there, Norm.\nMURRAYYou should be sharing these brilliant ideas with Uncle Sam, you know? 'Put all the money into B&M to supply the average American fighting man. He'll shoot off like a rocket, all the way to Berlin!'\n14.\n15.\nAt that moment a thunderous rattling cuts into their laughter as a steady stream of anti-aircraft tracers dance through the night sky.\nMore small arms fire echoes off in the distance. The woods are alive tonight, teeming with a murderous form of wildlife.\nEXT. THE HILLTOP TRENCHES - DAWN\nAnthony wakes up and struggles out of his thin blanket and bedroll, instinctively reaching for his gun.\nHe looks over and sees NORM, awake with eyes wide and gleaming. Everyone is pulling themselves out of various sleeping states into hastily organized fighting positions. Harry Meyers makes his way down the line, slapping the tops of helmets and growling words of encouragement.\nANTHONYNorm, what's happening.\nNorm gestures for Anthony to take a peek over the lip of the trench. He does so, just enough to glimpse an advancing COMPANY of German infantry and armored vehicles advancing through the snow. Anthony turns back inside the trench.\nA tiny VOLE pokes its head out of the snow a few feet away from where he is sitting. Snowflakes tumble from its oily black face as it climbs out and runs in the opposite direction.\nAnthony watches the animal until he loses sight of it as it blends in with the mud on the other side of the hilltop.\nAll of a sudden - WHAM - a mortar shell obliterates the spot - and two more soldiers along with it.\nA WAVE OF DIRT showers him.\nHis ears ring, but not enough to blot out the screams and gunfire that immediately commence following the explosion.\nThe fighting starts up again in earnest.\nAnthony scrounges around for his medic bag. He springs into action, maneuvering his way about the hilltop, crouched low, towards the closest injured man.\nAnthony gets beside a soldier who has a gunshot wound in his thigh, pops open the bag and starts tying a tourniquet. He also whips out a syrette and gives the fighter a hit of morphine.\n15.\n16.\nANTHONY(CONT'D)Stay with me hermano, it missed an artery, you're gonna be fine.\nHe looks around and sees a body slumped against a pile of rocks. A pattern of machine gun bullets have all but torn him in half at the midsection.\nAnthony recognizes the face.\nIt's MURRAY.\nAnthony crosses himself and gets back to work.\nAnthony darts from one man to another, eventually winding up by the side of NORM.\nNORMHey Anthony. This is it, huh? I never thought I'd die in the snow.\nAnthony looks around at the remaining men, maybe 50 in all. He starts to notice discarded rifles in fine working condition, and men have started to use pistols. The scene has a dream-like quality, surreal.\nThe ground is littered with empty green ammo cans and grenade boxes.\nSome men begin destroying their own equipment in anticipation of capture.\nOne big soldier hooks a grenade to a machine gun, pops the spoon on the grenade with a high-pitched PING, and hurls the whole mess down the hillside.\nIt blasts a huge crater in the snow with a resounding WHUMP and sends a trio of German soldiers flying backwards down the hill.\nAnother soldier scoops up a rock and throw it like a major league pitcher. It smashes into the face of a nearby German scrambling up the snowy hill, sending a few teeth glittering into the air.\nThe German snarls like a beaten dog, blood streaming from his mouth, and keeps charging.\nNORM(CONT'D)(in disbelief)We're going to be overrun, Tony.\nIt sounds like a stampede of buffalo on the hill.\n16.\n17.\nNorm and Anthony steel themselves for the final assault.\nThe first GERMAN SOLDIER clambers over the side of the trench. He is immediately followed by several more of his brethren.\nThe Americans fight back desperately with FISTS and BAYONETS.\nThe Germans subdue the crowd and hold the remaining survivors at gunpoint.\nThe Americans look like cornered pit bulls.\nA German HAUPTMANN (Captain) named KREUZER marches to the forefront and hollers above the din.\nKREUZER(in German)ENOUGH! Stop.\nHe walks over to Captain Harry Meyers, who is trembling in the cold and brandishing a BOWIE KNIFE at the somehow immaculate looking German officer.\nKREUZER(CONT'D)(switching to English)Throw down your weapon.\nMeyers eyes the officer. Well-armed German infantry surround the crowd.\nIn ONE SMOOTH MOTION, Meyers pops the button on his hip holster and whips out a pistol. He aims at Kreuzer's face and pulls the trigger.\nThe empty gun goes click.\nKreuzer doesn't even flinch.\nKREUZER(CONT'D)Look, as one officer to another, let's not be ridiculous, ah?\nMeyers holds his aim. His arm starts to tremble. About 30 German rifles are trained on him.\nAt last, he chucks the sidearm into the mud at Kreuzer's feet.\nKREUZER(CONT'D)Good. Now take off your fucking boots. Have your men do the same.\n17.\n18.\nMeyers stares at him. He bends down and slowly starts unlacing his boots. THE MEN - all who are able - drop their rifles and pistols and bend to one knee to follow Captain Meyers' lead.\nExcept for: one American RIFLEMAN, standing off to the side, near some German privates who are watching the spectacle and chuckling to themselves.\nTEARS stream down the young man's face. He checks his sidearm. One last round glints from the chamber.\nWithout warning, he points the gun at the closest German soldier and pulls the trigger as the guy is mid-sentence saying something to his friend.\nThe gun goes off with a thunderous roar.\nThe German SLUMPS to the ground like a ragdoll as blood spouts in arterial rhythm from a head wound.\nThe other soldiers shout and jump back in horror, then raise their weapons. A cacophonous volley of rifle fire drops the American.\nThe other Americans keep their heads down, submissive. Some Germans pace near the dead private, looking for any other prisoners who might be planning one last ambush.\nAnthony blows hard on his hands and tries to unlace his boots, which are coated in ice. He finally gets it done, and wriggles his bare feet in the snow.\nANTHONY(whispering to Norm)Shove your footwraps in your pocket and your boots in your shirt. If they get us into a truck we'll be okay.\nNorm does as he's told.\nNORMHow long before we get frostbite?\nANTHONYProbably about 30 minutes, at this rate.\nAnthony stands up, staring down once more at his bare feet. He flexes his toes.\n18.\n19.\nIn a trick of lighting and editing, the charred and snowy forest floor gradually TRANSITIONS into the tan stone of a pool deck.\nEXT. THE ACEVEDO POOL - DAY\nThe morning sun warms Anthony's skin.\n16-year-old Anthony is alone now, racing towards the lip of his family pool. He dives in, his movements mercurial.\nWe hear the tinny crackle of the underwater radio. It's set to another weekday marathon of upbeat ballads on the local AM dial.\nSmooth overhand strokes carry him through the water.\nA hiss of static blurts out from the radio.\nAnthony keeps swimming.\nA BLAST of static from the radio interrupts the song.\nAnthony takes a few more strokes and then pauses, treading in the lane. He stares at the radio. He ducks his head under water and holds his breath to listen.\nSuddenly, a lick of clearly audible MORSE CODE bleeps out from the speaker. Then another crackle of static, then back to the song at 100%.\nAnthony jerks backward in the water as though zapped.\nHe surges to the surface and gasps for air.\nAbove the water, it's quiet.\nANTHONY(in Spanish)What the fuck..?\nHe looks around. The pool deck is totally deserted. The cabana windows are shuttered. He swallows hard and dips below the surface once more.\nAll of a sudden a CRYSTAL CLEAR stream of Morse code emits from the speaker through the water.\nAnthony splashes for the surface and gets out of the pool.\nToweling off, he heads for the small outbuilding that contains his father's office.\n19.\n20.\nHe tries the handle to the front door.\nLocked.\nHe retrieves a key that's been hidden under the door mat. Inserting it into the door, he turns the lock and tries again to open it, but the door seems jammed. He presses his weight against the door, but it won't give way.\nHe steps back, then lunges forward to shove the door with his shoulder. It bangs open with a metallic CRUNCH as we cut to..\nEXT. ARDENNES FOREST - DAY\nA tailgate smashes shut on a German truck, sealing inside another load of gaunt American prisoners.\nANTHONY and NORM shuffle forward in a group of men yet to be loaded for transport. German troops patrol alongside them in good winter gear. The Americans look like frozen bundles of rags in comparison. Most of them have their hands up. The Germans sweep their guns over the men in lazy arcs.\nThe prisoners shift from one foot to another. They are all still barefoot.\nKREUZER approaches Anthony, snapping his fingers at the young medic.\nKREUZER(in English)You there. Stop. Don't I know you from somewhere?\nThe officer notices Anthony's red and white medical armband.\nKREUZER(CONT'D)A medic, I see. Why don't you come over here, I want to talk to you.\nMeanwhile, behind them, additional guys are climbing into the open trucks and trying to put their boots back on and rub some feeling into their feet.\nKREUZER(CONT'D)Come along then, don't be shy. I want to tell you some good news.\nAnthony shoots Norm a parting glance then stumbles over to the officer. Shards of ice stab into his feet.\nHe hugs himself and shivers. He can't help but stare at the Luger strapped to the officer's hip.\n20.\n21.\nANTHONY(defiant)What is it then?\nKREUZERYour comrades, they are all white. Why is that? You are Hispanic, yes?\nAnthony bristles.\nANTHONYYes.\nKREUZERYour country, it does not care about you, I think. You know this, do you not?\nHe refuses to answer.\nKREUZER(CONT'D)We have need for good doctors in Germany. I could send you to the best university in Munich, full ride. All you have to do is turn your back on a country that does not care about you.\nANTHONYI would never do that.\nThe big officer laughs. Snowflakes drift through the darkening air, accompanied by the grumbling of diesel engines.\nKREUZER(shrugging)Fine. Suit yourself. I don't really give a fuck.\nHe rests a hand menacingly on his holster, but cocks his head indicating for Anthony to get the hell back in line.\nAnthony catches up with Norm. Norm squeezes his shoulder.\nThey're at the waiting truck now. The boys clamber in the back and another German grunt slams the tail gate shut.\nEXT. TRUCK COLUMN - DAY\nThe trucks have driven until the break of dawn. The prisoners in the back are in rough shape, suffering badly from the cold and hunger.\n21.\n22.\nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE VOSGES MOUNTAINS - NIGHT\nA different column of freshly captured American G.I. prisoners marches through the night, hands raised, prodded along by the rifle barrels of German troops marching alongside them.\nSomewhere near the back walks the American HANS KASTEN, 27. His lineage is German but he fights for the U.S. He eyeballs the sparse number of guards.\nThey enter a ravine with dense forest on either side.\nHans works his way towards the end of the column by slowing down to let a comrade pass him, one at a time.\nHaving subtly leapfrogged his way to the back of the prisoner column, HANS slips off into the forest.\nEXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - NIGHT\nHANS creeps down the cobblestone street of a small town. Sounds of a firefight echo close by.\nHans runs over to a wooden cellar door at the base of an apartment building, and finds it unlocked.\nINT. CELLAR - NIGHT\nHe jumps through the doors and finds several sacks of potatoes lit by a warm lamp glow. Looking around, the sound of a cocked hammer greets his ears.\nHe slowly turns to the darkened corner and recognizes a red-faced AMERICAN OFFICER aiming a large handgun calmly in his direction. Hans wearily puts his hands up.\nHANSIt's okay, friendly.\nOFFICERDo you speak German?\nHANSWhat?\nThe officer lowers his weapon.\nOFFICERGerman, son, do you speak it??\n22.\n23.\nHANSYes, as a matter of fact I do.\nOFFICERLook, it's over. The other boys are upstairs. The goddamn Krauts will be here any minute. You can convince them not to slaughter us.\nHANSWhat are you doing down here?\nOFFICER(growing enraged)I... what? Get upstairs and await capture with the others, that's an order.\nHANSThat's not what I came here for. I escaped from a group of prisoners, a few miles from here. We were overrun in the mountains. I was the only one who escaped.\nThe officer actually starts to raise his pistol again.\nHans gives him a look of incredulity.\nOFFICERUpstairs, I said! You are to convey our unconditional surrender to the enemy.\nWithout another word, Hans inches up the stairs out of the cellar. The officer points the gun at Hans until he's out of sight.\nThe officer collapses on his ass against a sack of potatoes and puts his face in his hands, then begins to sob.\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\nHANS emerges on the ground floor and finds a squad of extremely spooked-looking American soldiers.\nThe platoon is crouched around a big window at the front. Pale blue moonlight reflects off the cobblestones, and an eerie calm seems to have settled over everything.\nThe men spin around to face Hans, but recognize his uniform and simply accept his presence. They resume gazing out the window.\n23.\n24.\nHANSWho has a spare rifle?\nA young second lieutenant at him with bewilderment.\nLIEUTENANTWhat are you talking about? There's an entire company of SS clearing this town out, house by house. We don't have a chance.\nHans looks disgusted. He spots a bloated German corpse in the corner of the first floor storeroom and strides over, wrenching an MP-40 submachine from the dead man's frozen fingers.\nHe pops the clip out to check the ammo, then grabs another magazine sticking out of the corpse's utility belt.\nCLOSE UP of the German corpse's face, the lips twisted into a fearsome grimace.\nAt that precise moment, a platoon of SS TROOPERS comes jogging around the corner of the town square, all stamping leather boots and metallic clacking of weaponry.\nThe other Americans in the storeroom quickly ascertain the overwhelming numbers and throw down their rifles, unbuckle grenades, etc. Some even toss their equipment underhand out into the middle of the street.\nHans can barely believe what is happening. He raises the MP-40 to his shoulder, trying to get a bead on the lead enemy soldier as they all close in, but there are too many surrendering friendlies in the way.\nThe SS stormtroopers pull up short and observe the surrendering Americans. Several of the Germans immediately start chuckling in nervous relief, at how the vicious Americans suddenly look so helpless and afraid.\nHans of course cannot get a shot without probably causing the deaths of just about everyone in the vicinity. Another green-faced PRIVATE happens to be hiding in the back of the room with him.\nHANSI'm getting the hell out of here. You coming?\nThe young private nods emphatically.\nThe Germans have begun fleecing their comrades, and Kasten and the private have thankfully not been noticed.\n24.\n25.\nKasten slings the MP-40 around his neck and the two young men haul ass through a busted out window set off in one shadowy corner.\nThey emerge into a snowy backyard. Hans briefly glances back through the window, just long enough to see the Germans roughing up their new prisoners, but there's nothing he can do.\nA sudden, muffled gunshot splits the silence, clearly echoing from the location of the basement.\nEXT. CEMETERY - DAWN\nDay breaks. Hans and his new companion stagger through the rows of headstones, somewhere on the outskirts of the war-torn French town of Verleaux. They are clearly frozen to the bone after marching through the night.\nHANS(teeth chattering)What's your name, Private?\nPRIVATEPrivate Banhart, sir.\nHANSYou got a first name, Private Banhart?\nPVT. BANHARTUh, yes sir, it's Stanley.\nHANSOkay Stanley Banhart, I'm Private Hans Kasten. You don't have to 'sir' me, either.\nPVT. BANHARTRight, sorry.\nThey look towards the end of the graveyard and spot what looks like a CASTLE, complete with high turrets and ramparts. If not a castle, a very well-fortified medieval looking building at least.\nThe two men notice some warm light, perhaps from cooking fires, along with the sounds of laughter and American accents drifting out through the arrow slits of the castle walls.\nPVT. BANHART(CONT'D)I think we should head in there. I can't feel my feet anymore.\n25.\n26.\nHANSNeither can I. We're almost there. Sounds like they might have something to eat. Or at least a way to get us warm.\nThey trudge forward.\nA SHOT rings out.\nAt that precise moment a sniper's bullet SHATTERS Stanley's skull, blowing out an exit wound in the front of his forehead the size of a grapefruit. He had lost his helmet sometime prior to that, and the hapless recruit topples forward like a mighty oak split by an ax.\nHans emits a shocked cry of horror, but instincts and training take over, and he goes scrambling for the nearest cover - a large tombstone.\nFrom there he darts out, breaking into a crouched run and zig-zagging, bobbing and weaving his way through the crowded maze of grave markers for the remaining 100 feet or so between him and safety of the building.\nReaching the castle wall at last, he hurls himself ass over teakettle through the nearest opening, a ground floor window.\nHe crashes through the window into a row of wooden benches in a huge, dusty heap. About a dozen or so other American soldiers look up, startled, from their huddled conversations.\nKasten is on his back, gasping to catch his breath.\nCamera shows Kasten's P.O.V. from his back as a variety of American FACES gather around him and stare down at their new compatriot.\nHANS(CONT'D)Anybody got a cigarette?\nINT. CASTLE - DAY\nThe ragtag band of American soldiers sits around a couple of metal oil drums that have low flames coming out of them. A few men nurse cigarettes or cups of stew, Kasten among them.\nHANSSo then he asked me if I spoke German, which I said that I did, and that he wanted help surrendering to the bastards when they got there.\n26.\n27.\nThe other soldiers grumble in disbelief.\nSuddenly an American SERGEANT with a thin cut trickling blood from one cheek bursts in through a door, clearly in a borderline panic.\nSERGEANTYou guys all gotta get into fighting positions, and I mean 5 minutes ago. About half the Volksgrenadier platoons in the entire goddamn country are headed this way.\nEveryone immediately springs into action and starts grabbing their helmets, rifles, grenades, etc. A random officer runs up to Kasten and shoves a Springfield M1903 rifle into his arms, which he gratefully accepts.\nOFFICERYou're a crack shot, right? Go take this up to the tower and see what you can do to discourage Jerry's advance.\nKasten locates a narrow stone spiral staircase set in one corner of the main hall and hustles in that direction. On his way, he scoops up two generous handfuls of rifle ammunition from a desk, and stuffs the brass rounds into his coat pockets.\nINT. CASTLE TOWER - DAY\nThe castle reverberates with the sounds of soldiers shouting to one another in preparation for the attack.\nKasten checks the scope on his newly issued Springfield and uses it to survey the cemetery that he had just run for his life through earlier.\nAn artillery shell crashes off the lawn between the graveyard and the structure, sending up a shower of grey dirt and rocky shrapnel.\nAs if on cue from the explosion, hordes of steel-helmeted German troops begin to materialize out of the shadowy treeline, then start filtering forward through the tombstones.\nAn armored personnel carrier also clatters through the trees and into the open, while a machine gunner in black goggles bounces around in the turret on top.\n27.\n28.\nKasten TAKES AIM at the closest German soldier he can find and FIRES. The bullet zips over the running Nazi's head and takes a huge chunk out of the top of a burial marker a couple meters behind him.\nThe cemetery is full of sprinting, crouched Germans now. The rest of the Americans in the castle open fire.\nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY\nView from the German advance. Every available window seems to erupt with automatic muzzle flashes as the Americans pour thunderous fire down into the cemetery. German commanders scream at their men to keep moving forward, in spite of the maelstrom enveloping them. One officer even circles the troops on horseback, only to be cut down by a burst of BAR fire a moment later.\nINT. CASTLE TOWER - DAY\nKasten takes another shot, but again he misses the mark, sending chips of granite flying off yet another headstone behind his intended target.\nGrowling with exasperation, Kasten checks the dials on his scope.\nECU - THE RIFLE SCOPE\nKasten's fingers work expertly, clicking the dials to account for the cross breeze, and to lower the ZEROING DISTANCE to 100 meters.\nINT. CASTLE TOWER - DAY\nNow with a properly sighted scope, Kasten begins licking shots at the Germans with lethal precision now. The battle seems to be shifting in their favor... almost, except...\nIt's not enough. Each enemy who falls slain to the earth seems to be replaced by two more. Kasten has too many targets to make sound decisions. He can't cycle the bolt on his rifle fast enough.\nA SHELL crashes into the tower, and Kasten is thrown to the floor. His rifle clatters away into a corner.\nA massive RINGING has completely drowned out all the sounds of the battle. His face is covered in grime from the explosion and he struggles to get up or regain any form of composure.\n28.\n29.\nGradually his hearing returns, only to reveal German voices shouting from somewhere INSIDE the castle now, followed by a significant amount of gunshots and more screaming.\nThey have been overrun.\nKasten can barely move. He winces in pain as he tries to turn himself over. The dreadful sound of HEAVY BOOTS stomping up the stairs fills his ears.\nHe looks helplessly over toward the rifle in the corner of the room, but there's nothing he can do to retrieve it.\nNext thing he knows, a huge German commando in green camouflage is standing over him with a repulsive grin smeared across his lips.\nKasten can't help but seem to focus on a gold tooth in the big Nazi's mouth, glinting in the silty afternoon light of the bombed out Belgian tower.\nThe butt of a Gewehr 43 rifle comes CRASHING DOWN on Kasten's forehead, and everything goes black.\nEXT. MAIN STREET, BAD ORB, GERMANY - DAY\nSUPER:\nBAD ORB, GERMANY.\nGrey trucks rumble through the center of a small German town, BAD ORB, population fewer than 10,000. Some German civilians come out to look. A weird spectacle in the middle of an otherwise semi-normal workday.\nINT. BACK OF GERMAN TRUCK - DAY\nThe shelter of the truck has given the soldiers at least a sliver of hope for warmth. They press against each other for body heat. At least the sun is out. Norm and Anthony watch the townsfolk emerge and then recede from view around the road bend through the open flap of the truck.\nNorm and Anthony stare back at the comfortable looking and well dressed townsfolk, hardly able to comprehend the circumstances.\nNORM(dazed)Out of the frying pan into the fire.\n29.\n30.\nEXT. HILLS OUTSIDE BAD ORB - DAY\nThe trucks gradually ease out of the town and head for the forested hills that surround the berg. The convoy rolls along a road that parents used to drive up to bring their kids to summer camp.\nThat same camp has been converted to Stalag IX-B.\nEXT. STALAG IX-B, AERIAL SHOT - DAY\nThe camp unfolds in a sweeping shot as a huge scar cut out of the trees on a sweeping hillside. Barracks stretch out in a slight ellipse, like the sickle shape of a new moon. A huge scar in the natural beauty.\nThe trucks rumble through a series of barbed wire checkpoints. An abandoned playground stands off to one side.\nThe prisoners observe what they can through the back flap and the gaps in the canvas. A huge group of mostly RUSSIANS, plus Serbs and Frenchmen, has moved in to crowd along the fence that leads into the camp. Their faces are gaunt. They have seen the untold horrors of the eastern front.\nA GERMAN GUARD in a watchtower hunches over an MG42 machine gun. He munches on an apple as he brushes his sights over the trucks, and the Soviet prisoners.\nA man who relishes his work.\nThe trucks park in a big dirt lot near what looks like an admin building. German guards usher the prisoners out of the trucks at rifle-point, barking orders that need no translation. Guys obediently start lining up in neat formation.\nEXT. STALAG IX-B - CAMP CLEARING - DAY\nThe prisoners are marched over to a big square courtyard in front of the admin building, the white barracks standing off in the background. A series of tables have been set up to stand in the dirt, at each German military CLERK or some such functionary snaps open a wooden folding chair and sits down to a TYPEWRITER.\nThe Americans - still half frozen and some near death from the battle - shuffle into queues. Names, ranks, and serial numbers are reported one by one.\nFINGERS mash keys.\n30.\n31.\nCLERK (V.O.)Snyder... Millstone... Scruggs...\nNUMBERS are issued to each man in line. A gloved hand shoves the typewriter to the left margin to start a new line with a metallic RING.\nCLERK (V.O.)26481... 25074... 26588...\nA trio of Americans inches forward in the line. They whisper excitedly to each other. They are Hans Kasten, along with JOE LITTEL, and ERNST SINNER. Hans has the most striking features of the group, with a dark mustache and goatee. He bears a large welt on his forehead. They all look worn to the bone. ERNST and JOE are young American fighters with European immigrant parents, just like Hans.\nERNSTI could take it for a few more hours if I just had something to eat.\nHANSTry to think about something else.\nLittle by little, each soldier receives a small, metal tag with their prisoner number on it. After they are processed, the guards march them over to a low set of barracks reserved for the Americans.\nThe P.O.W.'s from the other countries remain on the other side of a 5-foot wide dirt corridor lined on each side with 12-foot tall wire fencing. They still stare, watching the registration process, like curious ghosts.\nA German guard comes over and for no reason JABS Joe Littel in the ribs with his rifle barrel. Joe winces in pain as the guard smiles.\nGUARD(accented English)'We're Not in Kansas, anymore?' Ja Amerikaner??\nJOE stares at him. The guard leers at him stupidly, his eyes sparkling yet vacant. The depraved guard raises his rifle butt again, this time to break Joe's shoulder.\nHans puts his hands up between them.\n31.\n32.\nHANS(in fluent German)Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on now, easy there. He didn't do anything to you.\nThe guard is so surprised he actually stops, he rifle butt frozen in mid-air. He lowers the weapon to his side.\nGUARD(in German)Who the fuck are you?\nHANSNo one. Please, just put the gun down. We won't give you any trouble.\nGUARDI don't know who you think you're talking tHANSThink of all the paperwork if he dies because of you. It wouldn't be worth it!\nThe guard is still blown away by this slick American with the flawless German. He has to admit it. The guy is right.\nThe guard shakes his head in amusement and moves along, going over to a friend, where they confer together and shoot looks back at Hans and Joe.\nHans, Joe, and Ernst snap their eyes forward, to the line.\nINT. BARRACKS - NIGHT\nIt's the first night in the camp. The men are crammed into a barracks that is too crowded by about 30 guys. Exhausted prisoners crawl into bunk beds stacked three high, three across.\nIn the throes of hunger, guys try to get some sleep, mostly in vain. A few chests heave with the gentle rhythm of unconsciousness.\nAnthony is not one of the lucky ones to drift off. He stares wide-eyed at the bunk above him, two more guys right beside him. He puts his hands together and mouths soundless words, a Catholic prayer.\n32.\n33.\nA gentle snore floats up from somewhere in the barracks. A cough or two.\nAnthony can see through the muddy glass of a barracks window. His vision is good - he can make out a few spindly pine tree branches just beyond the wire - and in them, he suddenly spots a beautiful white owl. It tilts its head, then fluffs its wings to reveal pure downy feathers below.\nA THUMP breaks his concentration.\nThe door to the barracks slams open to reveal the silhouettes of a Gestapo chief named KURT SIEBER, 39. He is flanked by a pair of guards.\nThe trio marches into the barracks. Moonlight glints off the officer's MONOCLE, reflecting the orange ember of a cigarette jutting from his teeth.\nThe rest of the men slowly prop themselves up on elbows to watch the scene unfold.\nThe Gestapo officer makes a beeline for ANTHONY'S bunk with no hesitation.\nSIEBERAnthony Acevedo?\nANTHONYYes.\nSIEBERI hate to disturb you, but would you accompany me please? We would like to discuss something with you.\nAnother German speaking polished English. The politeness is a toxic sign, like a spider luring a fly. Not much choice, obviously. Anthony tries to hide his fear, mostly succeeding.\nANTHONYCan I ask what this is about?\nThe officer regards Anthony as one regards a small child who has asked a particularly stupid question.\nSIEBERAll will be explained.\nAnthony casts a look around the room at his COMRADES, who stare back with a mixture of desperation, pity, and curiosity.\n33.\n34.\nINT. INTERROGATION CHAMBER - ADMIN BUILDING - NIGHT\nThe guards shove Anthony into a dimly lit interrogation room somewhere in the depths of the guardhouse. There's nothing in the room but a metal table, a pair of chairs, and a dangling lightbulb.\nThe guards exit. The officer motions for Anthony to sit. Anthony does so, and the German takes a seat opposite him.\nHe offers Anthony a cigarette, which he accepts. The German officer lights it for him with an air of respect.\nSIEBERI know, I know. You're wondering why I dragged you out of bed in the middle of the night.\nAnthony is understandably a little freaked out. This is the first Nazi he's really seen up close.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Well, the reason I called you in here, Private Acevedo, is that we've got quite the little file on you already.\nAnthony still does not speak.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Your father, Francisco, he still lives in Durango, yes? Or have they moved to Pasadena by now? I can't remember. And has he had any dealings with the local hardware store owners, perhaps? A certain pair of German hardware store owners in Mexico?\nANTHONYHow do you know that?\nSIEBER(laughing amiably)I know lots of things. The sooner you come to accept that, the better this is going to go for you.\nANTHONYWhat do you mean? Yes, all right, my father had some dealings with the Schraders, in Mexico. What of it?\n34.\n35.\nSIEBERYou and your father got them arrested, didn't you? You knew they were working for the Third Reich and you ratted them out.\nAnthony's eyes grow sullen as he returns the hard gaze of the smooth-talking Nazi.\nANTHONYAll I can tell you is my name, rank, and serial number.\nSIEBERRight, right, I've seen that movie. The tough American won't give in to questioning. Well, I hate to break it to you, but this isn't a movie.\nSIEBER takes out a small black case from his breast pocket.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)(in German)Guards!\nThe steel door slams open and the thugs storm in. SIEBER pulls a long needle out of the case. Anthony's never seen anything like it before.\nOne guard pins one of Anthony's arms painfully behind his back, while the other slams his hand down on the table in front of the Gestapo officer. He forces Anthony's fingers outward, splayed, his palm mashed against the table.\nANTHONYI don't know what the hell you're talking about!\nWithout further warning SIEBER begins to insert the needle beneath the nail of Anthony's index finger. Slowly. He screams.\nSIEBERYou and your father's actions led to the execution of two German spies. You heard their communication and reported it to your father. It's your fault they're dead, Anthony.\nSIEBER pulls out the needle. Tears stream from Anthony's eyes.\n35.\n36.\nANTHONYI... didn't know anything about it. What happened to them.\nSIEBER(laughing)Well what on earth did you think would happen, young man? Do you have anything at all to say in your defense? I suppose not. I heard a lieutenant made you a rather generous proposal when you were captured. Why didn't you take it?\nThe guards let up his arm. Anthony ignores Sieber. He stares at the floor and holds his hand tenderly. A tiny trickle of blood leaks out of one finger.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Regardless. I am going to enjoy making your life a living hell for the remainder of the war. You must make amends for your crimes against the Third Reich and the good people of Germany.(switching to German)Get him the fuck out of here.\nThe guards haul Anthony to his feet and drag him out of the chamber.\nINT. APARTMENT - PASADENA, CALIFORNIA - DAY\nA sunlit kitchen in a small apartment. A mail slot snaps open and a small bundle of letters drops through. Anthony's MOTHER swings by the door and scoops up the mail.\nShe makes her way to the kitchen and inspects the top letter on the stack. It's from the U.S. Army. She gasps and tears the letter open.\nECU - THE LETTER\nClose up of the letter, focused enough to read: \"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Acevedo, we regret to inform you that your son has been reported captured or missing.\" etc.\nShe screams for her husband, tossing the letter on the counter like it's electrified. She dashes off to find her him.\nThe camera remains on the letter.\n36.\n(MORE)\n37.\nSounds of clamor reverberate through the apartment as she breaks the news to Francisco.\nEXT. BARRACKS - DAY\nHans Kasten and a few comrades (Tony Acevedo, William Shapiro, Joe Littel, and Ernst Sinner, among others) mill around outside the main barracks.\nThey look over towards a much larger group of prisoners - RUSSIANS, mainly, who stare back at them through the wire with sunken eyes.\nERNSTHow many of those poor bastards you think'll make it out of here alive?\nHANSWho knows. We don't know that any of us are making it out.\nERNSTCan't get worse than this, though, can it?\nHans looks at him like he was born yesterday.\nHANSIt can always get worse, Ernie.\nHe gestures over to another part of the prison yard, to a barracks set back from the others, obscured by a maze of barbed wire. A few dark-haired, emaciated looking prisoners float in and out of the shadows.\nHANS(CONT'D)You know what that is?\nErnst can only stare.\nEXT. CAMP PARADE GROUND - STALAG IX-B - DAY\nA few weeks later. The American P.O.W.'s all stand in military formation. A few snowflakes drift through the air. Their breath comes out in white plumes.\nKurt Sieber strides into frame.\nSIEBERSome of you are going to be very lucky today.\n(MORE)\n37.\nSIEBER (CONT'D)\n38.\nFor some of you, today marks your departure from this camp.\nHe stops, considering the ranks of Americans. Many cannot control their shivering. They stand mute in their worn out uniforms and coats as the January sun struggles to break through the clouds.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)All Jews take one step forward. Do it quickly, now.\nHe glances out over the crowd. No one moves.\nClose up of a dog tag on someone's chest. Clearly visible is the stamped \"H\" for Hebrew. A Jewish soldier pops off his tag as subtly as possible and lets it fall to the ground. With the toe of his boot he buries it in the snow.\nAnother soldier rips off a tiny Star of David pendant and pops it into his mouth, struggling to swallow it with a hard grimace.\nThe commandant scans the ranks. He doesn't catch any of the furtive movements. Guards stand pat behind him, rifles on shoulders. A breeze ruffles their trench coats. Sieber checks his watch.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Look, if you don't comply I'm just going to start shooting people.\nAnthony glances around, unsure what to do. He can see fear creeping into his friends' faces.\nSieber sighs and pops the button on his holster, drawing his trusty Luger. He looks at the Americans expectantly.\nHe walks over to Hans Kasten and cocks the hammer.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Well?\nHANS(resorting to German)Don't do this comrade commandant, there's no difference among us. We're all Jews here.\nSieber is amused at the audacity.\nSIEBERIs that so?\nSIEBER (CONT'D)\n38.\n39.\nThere is no humor in his voice however. He suddenly holsters his pistol, strides over to the nearest guard and tears a  rifle from the man's hands. Returning to Kasten, he winds up as if he's about to hit a home run and SMASHES Kasten's stomach with the butt of the Mauser. Kasten crumples to the deck, his breath gone in a whoosh.\nHe struggles to get up and Sieber delivers another knock to his back.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Fucking traitor to the Fatherland. Not worth the bloody cartridge. I'm going inside.\nHe spits ferociously at Kasten, then motions to the guards.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Keep an eye on them. If anyone moves, shoot the four men to the sides of him. And beat Kasten again if he even looks at you funny. Either way he just volunteered for this detail and signed his own death warrant.\nSieber stalks back inside the admin building, leaving the guards in the clearing and the towers to watch over the formation of Americans. Kasten is still in the fetal position, trying to regain his breath.\nEXT. COURTYARD - 2 HOURS LATER - DAY\nSIEBER comes back outside after enjoying a pleasant breakfast and some coffee. Meanwhile, some of the Americans' lips have begun to turn blue. Kasten is somehow standing up again, but he looks awful.\nThere are at least two clusters of dead men surrounding a surviving private. The soldiers in the middle are hunched or lying on the ground in the fetal position. Blood streaks the dirt.\nSIEBERIn any case, have we had enough of this little exercise? I have a quota needs filling. I knew Americans were naive but I didn't take them to be this stupid.\n39.\n40.\nERNST(hissing)We need to step forward. There's no other option.\nHANSI know.\nJOEBut I'm not even Jewish..\nHANSDoes that matter?\nERNSTWe're probably dead either way Joe. They'll shoot everyone if we don't move. At least we can take the option that keeps us together.\nJoe casts his eyes to the ground.\nJOEI'll go.\nEXT. CAMP CLEARING - DAY\nAnthony turns to Norm. The cold is causing his knees and shoulders to slump to the point where he looks about to fall, but impossibly never quite has - yet.\nA guard scans the ranks for dissent. Off to his right he catches the motion of Ernst Sinner and Joe Littel stepping forward.\nAnthony grabs Norm's arm and tries to raise him up a little. Norm snaps out of it for the moment, like a man coming out of a light doze.\nANTHONYNorm, come on buddy, things are happening. We're going to be out of this soon.\nA few other men, Jewish or not, step forward as well. A couple of the guards look like they're going to be sick.\nSieber starts strolling around among the changing formation as more guys start to step forward.\nSIEBERThat's more like it!\n40.\n41.\nBy this point over a hundred men have volunteered for whatever cruelty the Nazis have devised this time.\nAnthony stays put for the moment, not sure what to do about Norm. Calculating not his own, but his friend's best chances for survival.\nBefore he can make up his mind, Sieber strides into frame.\nANTHONYSir, this man needs help, I...\nSIEBERWell what do we have here. Sergeant Acevedo.\nNORM(mumbling)Forget about it, Tony.\nSIEBERI need more men for my quota. You just volunteered, mi amigo. You and him can stick together, for that matter.\nHe pokes Norm in the ribs with a baton.\nSIEBER(CONT'D)Heads up, soldier. You've been selected. Step forward.\nNorm gamely drags his legs forward two steps. Anthony does so as well\nEXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY\nA line of boxcars stands in the depot. The men are crammed inside. Hollowed out faces stare from the slats of the windows. The soldiers have begun to bear little resemblance to their former selves who went out on patrol that fateful day.\nINT. BOXCAR - DAY\nNORM and ANTHONY are pressed against one window, sucking air. Anthony manages to reach through and break off an icicle near the opening, and he brings it back in without shattering or dropping it. He snaps off half and hands it to Norm. They nurse their crippling thirst together.\n41.\n42.\nNORMFeels like I walked out of the wire factory a lifetime ago.\nANTHONYWe can survive this, Norm, don't you worry. We're protected under the Geneva Convention.\nNORMI don't think that will hold much weight where we're going. Or anywhere, with them.\nSomewhere a brake releases and the train gives a small lurch.\nANTHONYBe thankful this isn't the summertime. At least we can melt the snow for some water.\nMen are struggling to stand, dealing with stomach cramps. There is a corner where those with the worst bodily urges relieve themselves.\nThe train's wheels begin to grind into motion and the boxcars roll out of the depot.\nNORMSomething tells me we have a very long way to go.\nEXT. THE P.O.W. TRAIN - NIGHT\nThe train carrying all the prisoners who were \"selected\" trundles along through the night, like some fantasy apparatus out of a medieval nightmare.\nCoal smoke and soot has begun to turn the men's faces into the same color as the outside of the train, burnt black and oily.\nThe train crosses a massive bridge built of majestic stone archways as it emits a column of grey smoke. There are some lights along the train and in the conductors cabin. Snow continually drifts down from the sky like the ashes of dead cities.\nINT. BOXCAR - NIGHT\n42.\n43.\nJack Vogel, the scout, sits on the vibrating wooden floor with two of his close friends, WINFIELD ROSENBERG, 23, and MORTON GOLDSTEIN, 22, both Artillerymen from the 106th infantry division.\nVOGEL...and then his hand moved, I thought he was going to scoop that gun off the snow and finish me off.\nROSENBERGYou're kidding me right? That can't be real. The guy was deader than a doornail, I assure you.\nVOGELWere you there? He twitched, all right? He twitched!\nGOLDSTEINFellas, relax. I believe you, Jack. It's fine.\nRosenberg shrugs; he wasn't looking for a fight.\nROSENBERGJust making small talk.\nVOGELYeah, might as well make some more of it.\nAnthony and Norm are huddled against a wall.\nANTHONYYou okay?\nNORMNot particularly. They gonna feed us when we get there, you think?\nANTHONYThey'll give us something, they have to.\nAnthony pats his friend on the shoulder.\nANTHONY(CONT'D)We'll get something.\nThe train hurries on into the night.\n43.\n44.\nEXT. ACEVEDO BACKYARD - DURANGO - DAY\nFlashback to 1941 again. We find ourselves in the backyard of the Acevedo family home. The yard is filled with green grass and beautiful foliage. Orchids, creepers, and hyacinth vines dot the scenery.\nIn the middle of all the lush vegetation sits Anthony's father, Francisco. He is lounging on a pool chair. He closes his eyes with pleasure as he takes a long sip of from an icy cocktail.\nA thin shadow slips over Francisco. 16-year-old Anthony suddenly appears by his side.\nFRANCISCO(in Spanish)I already know what you're going to say, I think.\nAnthony swallows hard. He didn't think his father even knew he was there yet.\nANTHONYFather?\nFRANCISCOYou saw me with those men the other day. The ones who were interested in buying the rifle, yes?\nANTHONY(bowing his head)Yes, I saw you talking to them. It was after swim practice, I only happened to be passing by...\nFrancisco waves a hand.\nFRANCISCOIt's fine. I don't care if you see me conducting business. A boy should be exposed to such things. That is not what we're talking about here. I had a very interesting encounter at the hardware store today.\nANTHONY(blurting out)I heard German coming from the speakers in the pool! I just left a tip at the police station, I didn't know what else to do.\n44.\n45.\nFrancisco waits, measuring his response. He can't help but widening his eyes in moderate surprise.\nFRANCISCOSit down, son. I know you did.\nAnthony stares at his father, not understanding. He obediently takes a seat on the adjacent chair.\nFRANCISCO(CONT'D)We do our part to fight fascism. We expose them straight to hell. That means, every chance we get.\nANTHONYWhat happened?\nFRANCISCOWhen you were at school the other day, I paid a visit to their hardware store, just to check in, see if the Schraders had tried their rifle at the range yet, maybe pick up a few spare boxes of nails, you know.\nINT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY\nFrancisco strolls into the shop, looking around for the Schraders, browsing the shelves a bit, etc.\nFRANCISCO (V.O.)When I got there though, the shop was totally empty. No one at the register, no one in the aisles.\nFrancisco calls out \"Hello?\" In the flashback, getting no response. He makes his way towards the back of the store, finding his way past the counter and up to the threshold of the back office. He seems to debate whether to peek in and investigate the back office outright, or wait and see if anyone shows up. He gives it a minute, but no one does.\nFRANCISCO (V.O.) (CONT'D)I decided, for the good of the Mexican state, I had better check it out.\nFrancisco peers through the window set in the office door. He observes the recently sold M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle resting against the wooden desk. He sees scattered papers, and a few loose .30-06 caliber cartridges lying next to a half empty box magazine.\n45.\n(MORE)\n46.\n He also spies a pamphlet, with a partially obscured SWASTIKA beneath an unmistakable iron eagle symbol.\nSUDDENLY SCHRADER is behind him. He is seen wiping something RED and smeary off his hands.\nFrancisco JUMPS.\nSCHRADER(speaking accented Spanish)Mr. Acevedo! What a pleasant surprise to see you here.\nFRANCISCOMr. Schrader, nice to see you as well.\nSCHRADERYou must forgive me, but this is not the best time. Unfortunately I have to close the shop early today. Muriel has come down with something, you see.\nFrancisco gestures to the red smears.\nFRANCISCODoing some painting?\nSchrader looks down, as if he'd forgotten all about it.\nSCHRADEROh, this... yes! Just putting a fresh coat on a few, um... How you say..\nFRANCISCO(trying to be helpful but getting freaked out)Shelves?\nSCHRADERYes! Thank you. Shelves. Those metal ones in the basement I use for extra stock.\nThe men pause awkwardly, staring at one another.\nSCHRADER(CONT'D)Would you care to see some other projects I've got cooking in the basement?\n(MORE)\n46.\nSCHRADER (CONT'D)\n47.\nI think some of what I'm working on might interest you. Potentially.\nFrancisco is looking increasingly spooked. At this point he's keenly aware that something is not right here.\nFRANCISCOYou know, I'd love to, but maybe some other time. Maria'll kill me if I don't get home in time to marinate the steak we're having tonight. You know how it is... You'll be wanting to tend to Muriel, I expect?\nSchrader stares blankly at Francisco.\nSCHRADERWhat?\nFRANCISCOYour wife..?\nFrancisco's hand rests on the counter that houses the cash register. There are some odds and ends lying about, including a long, lethal-looking screwdriver. His hand imperceptibly twitches towards it.\nThey both lunge for the screwdriver at the same time, but Francisco is faster.\nFrancisco snatches the screwdriver off the counter, but Schrader immediately spins toward him and TACKLES the older man.\nThe combatants slam to the floor, which sends the screwdriver skittering off into one of the aisles.\nThey wrestle viciously in a life-or-death struggle. Schrader curses at Francisco in German, while trying to get his hands around his throat, but using that famous OLD MAN STRENGTH, Francisco holds him at bay. But just barely.\nSuddenly, we hear the CLICK of a revolver's hammer being cocked.\nThe shot expands to reveal a Mexican police officer holding the gun.\nOFFICERHands up. Slowly.\nSchrader puts his hands up and, careful not to make any sudden movements, gets off Francisco.\nSCHRADER (CONT'D)\n47.\n48.\nThe Mexican cops hastily throw handcuffs on SCHRADER and hustle him out the front door of the hardware store. They stuff him into a big black van waiting for them.\nEXT. FRONT OF STORE - DAY\nFrancisco comes outside too, rubbing his neck. The cops slam the van door with their new prisoner inside. There are no windows for him to peer out of. Just like that, Schrader has become a ghost.\nA Mexican DETECTIVE in a suit strides over to Francisco and starts talking to him.\nFRANCISCO (V.O.)A fellow came over and asked if I knew him. I saw no reason to lie and said that I did. They said they were interested in tracking down his partner, the cousin.\nEXT. ACEVEDO BACKYARD - DAY\nAnthony is sitting in the grass now, listening to his father relate the tale, a dumbstruck expression on his teenage face.\nANTHONYAre you fucking kidding me??\nFRANCISCOAnthony! Your mother would wash your mouth out with soap if she heard you use such language.\nHe pauses to take another sip of his drink, and pauses to light a cigarette.\nFRANCISCO(CONT'D)Anyway, the guy told me they'd been trailing the Schraders for a while on suspicion of espionage on behalf of the Third Reich. It wasn't until they received your note that they had all the information they needed to make an arrest. He told me they'd been intercepting radio communications for some time now. Apparently the Schraders were not the most sophisticated when it came to their knowledge of spy craft.\n48.\n49.\nANTHONYDid you tell them about the gun?\nFRANCISCONo... I felt that would be... unnecessary. If the Schraders tell them about the sale, and the police come knocking, well, we have nothing to hide. We knew nothing of their activities.\nANTHONYWhat if they told their handlers about us?\nFRANCISCOThat's the only thing I'm still worried about. Unless there are other SS sleeper cells in Durango, I don't see any way that they could get to us, however.\nEXT. BERGA CONCENTRATION CAMP - LATER - NIGHT\nThe locomotive clatters slowly along tracks that lead into the camp.\nGuards and spotlights are everywhere. Snow falls in a heavy curtain amid the grey smoke and the lurching train.\nThe boxcars grind to a HALT, now inside the camp proper. Guards walk up and unlatch the boxcar doors, ushering the prisoners out at gunpoint. With all the snow and random crates and oil drums, the place looks like an alien planet.\nWith muttered commands, the guards force the prisoners to line up along the side of the train.\nA large guardhouse with ornate gables stands up ahead in the distance, at the end of a snowy cobblestone walkway.\nA German officer strides out of the front door, clad in the uniform of the National Guard, although he takes his orders from the SS.\nHe makes his way up and down the prisoners, eyeballing each man.\nMETZGood evening, gentlemen! You've just arrived at Berga am der Elster, subcamp of Buchenwald. You are in excellent hands!\n49.\n50.\nHe stops at Morton Goldstein.\nMETZ(CONT'D)You've been sent here for a specific purpose. Divine fate has brought you here before me so I can use you for it. Are you ready to learn what it is?\nA handful of American corpses remain in the boxcars.\nMetz pats Goldstein on the cheek and winks at him.\nMETZ(CONT'D)That's it, you've guessed it! You're here to work.\nHe moves on from Goldstein, to the young man's great relief.\nMETZ reaches Anthony and stops, eyeballing him as well.\nHe stares at Anthony, looking directly into his large hazel eyes. Metz's jaw is coated in a layer of salt & pepper stubble, and the bags under his eyes are light purple. His National Guardsman's cap is cocked at a jaunty angle.\nMETZ(CONT'D)You were chosen to come here, because you are the bottom of the barrel. Yes?\nAnthony refuses to waver under the officer's gaze.\nEXT. BERGA CAMP HILLSIDE - DAY\nThe men hurry up the hill towards their new \"homes\", a series of barracks built into the muddy ground, much shabbier than the previous camp, surrounded by barbed wire fences and machine gun towers.\nMETZ (V.O.)You're to begin building tunnels for the Third Reich. You can consider this an honor and a privilege, and after the war I'm told that all non-Jews among your contingent MAY have repatriation opportunities at your disposal.\n50.\n51.\nANTHONY slows down as he catches sight of something. Beyond the wire, near a river and what appear to be narrow gauge rail tracks, he spots hunched over figures running to and fro, garbed in striped pajamas and paper hats. They are impossibly thin, yet carry chunks of rock and push mine carts along the rails.\nOne of the ghost-like figures suddenly stops, noticing Anthony. They stare at each other, making eye contact from a few hundred feet away. Then, the figure catches sight of an SS officer wandering over from nearby. He runs off in order to avoid a serious beating.\nMany of the Americans don't look any better. They rub their shoulders, shivering hard in the frigid February air.\nStalag IX-B has taken a heavy toll, and conditions are only about to deteriorate further.\n51."}

HOME LIBRARY\nA room with a large oak desk, office chair, and shelves\nfilled with books from floor to ceiling. There is also a\nlarge cabinet, upon which there sits an old record player. A\nsmall child, ROGER, 11 years old, runs into the library and\ngoes straight for the cabinet. He opens it to reveal a large\ncollection of vintage LPs. He looks through for a moment,\ncarefully considering them, and then selects one and places\nit on the turntable. \"Freight Train Blues\" by Bob Dylan\ncrackles through the speakers. Roger runs out of the library,\nupstairs, and into a small bedroom down the hall. Toys are\nscattered about, and there are two beds in the room. Playing\non the floor is Roger's young brother WILL, 8 years old. He\nis adding tracks to a toy train set.\nROGER\nCome on, Will! Let's go outside!\nWILL\nBut... I just set up the station...\nROGER\nYou can play trains later. I found\nsome chairs and stuff that Dad said\nwe can put in the treehouse. Come\non!\nWill reluctantly abandons his toys and they both run outside.\nEXT. A LARGE FARMHOUSE - DAY\nA white farmhouse stands on a hill with a large sprawling\nyard, and a lush vegetable garden nearby. Oak and birch trees\ndot the property, and there are various signs that children\nlive here. A swing set, a treehouse, etc. Just beyond the\ngarden is a small pond surrounded by cattails. A cool breeze\ntemporarily alleviates the heat of the bright summer day, and\nthe trees in the forest gently rustle their leaves. The boys\ncome out of the house and run down the hill towards the\nforest.\nEXT. FOREST - DAY\nMain titles roll over the music, and the brothers play in the\nforest behind their house.\nINT. BARN - DAY\nThey go to a large aluminum barn, which lies in the distance\ndown a narrow dirt path. Once inside they climb up into the\nrafters, and they walk along them high above the ground as if\nthey were balance beams no more than three feet high. The sun\nbegins to set. Fade music.\nEXT. THE POND - LATER\nThe boys walk around the edge of the pond. Roger carries a\nsmall net, and Will points out frogs for Roger to try and\ncatch.\nTheir father comes to the door of the house. He is clean\nshaven, wearing glasses - tall and skinny. He stands on the\nporch and watches his sons play with a look of deep fondness.\nHe calls out to them.\nDAD\nCome on in boys, it's almost time\nto eat!\nWILL\nJust a minute dad, I see a really\nbig bastard!\nDAD\n(mock angrily)\nWill!! Do not use that word.\nWILL\nSorry dad. Roger taught it to me.\nROGER\nI did not!\nDAD\nAll right, all right. Come inside!\nI made us a nice Sunday dinner.\nThe boys hurry up the hill and into the house with their\nfather.\nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT\nA warmly lit dining room, with three places set at a large\noak table. Family photos line the wall; among the photos\nthere are pictures of the boys, their father, and also a\nwoman, their mother.\n2.\nThe boys bring food to the table, and Roger makes sure Will\nis putting everything in the right place. They all sit down\nat the table, eager to begin the meal. Dad begins dishing out\nsalad and the boys pick out hamburgers and hot dogs from the\nplate in the middle.\nDAD\nWhat did you two do today?\nROGER\nWell, we did a bunch of work on the\ntreehouse.\nWILL\nYeah dad, we put the chairs up\nthere and they look really great!\nRoger said we could bring a radio\nup there and listen to music.\nROGER\nAnd we want a couch and a table...\nMaybe a bookshelf. Hey dad can we\nlive up there?\nDAD\nSure but I'm gonna rent out your\nrooms.\nWILL\nWhat?!\nDAD\nI'm kidding, I'm kidding. But I\ndon't think you want to live out\nthere. What happens when it rains?\nWILL\nMaybe you could help us with the\nroof or something?\nROGER\nYeah we could put on shingles and\nstuff and make it rainproof.\nDAD\nWe'll see...so Roger, I noticed\nyou've been listening to a lot of\nmy records lately. Do you have a\nfavorite album yet?\n3.\nROGER\nI don't know.. I really like the\nBob Dylan album, with the song\nabout being followed by two white\nhorses.\nWILL\nI don't like that one, Roger, it's\nscary.\nThe meal is finished, and Dad gets up to start clearing the\ndishes.\nROGER\n(to Will)\nWhat's the one you really like? The\none with the old-fashioned picture\non the front, the haystack...right?\nWILL\nJohn Barleycorn!\nDAD\nWow, that one takes me back. I\nlistened to that all the time in\nhigh school. You guys are way ahead\nof me.\nROGER\nWho is he supposed to be?\nDad comes back to the table with three bowls of ice cream.\nDAD\nWell, the story of John Barleycorn\ngoes way back in English folk\ntradition. As the legend goes, John\nwas not a real person, but he\nbecame the personification of\nbarley - do you know what that is?\nThe boys nod somewhat uncertainly.\nDAD (CONT'D)\nWell, barley was very important in\nEnglish agriculture because it was\nused to make beer and whiskey...\nthose are um, alcoholic drinks,\nyou'll learn more about those when\nyou're older.\nThe boys grin at each other.\n4.\nDAD (CONT'D)\nAnyway, the idea was that barley,\nthe crop itself, was just like a\nperson. It had to be raised\nproperly, like any child, and taken\ncare of as it got older. Above all,\nit needed to be respected.\nOtherwise, bad things could happen.\nEXT. A BARLEY FIELD - DAY - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE\nWe are transported to a time long ago, the middle ages.\nEnglish peasants work in the massive barley field with\ngleaming scythes. It is mid-Autumn, when Spring-planted\nBarley is harvested. They gather the crop in large bushels\nlashed to their backs.\nINT. AN OLD MILL - DAY\nWe see the peasants grinding the barley with large millstones\nin an old barn.\nDAD (V.O.)\nHe was viewed as a religious figure\nbecause when he dies, so to speak,\nhis body is turned into bread, and\nthe idea is that he suffered a lot\nbefore dying, which he did in order\nto help them.\nINT. THE DINING ROOM - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT\nThe boys are enchanted by the story, and listen intently to\nwhat else their father has to say.\nDAD\nThe lesson of the story is that\nwhen someone sacrifices so much to\nhelp you, it's necessary to treat\nthat person with the utmost\nrespect. If you treated John\nBarleycorn poorly, you could end up\non his bad side. Then your family\ncould go hungry... or worse, sober!\nThe boys both snicker.\nWILL\nI like that story.\n5.\nROGER\nMe too.\nDAD\nI'm glad it interests you so much.\nMaybe there's some way you can\nlearn more about it, we ought to go\nto the library tomorrow.\nThe table is cleared, and the boys look very sleepy.\nDAD (CONT'D)\nWell, it's getting late. You two\nshould get to bed, whaddya say?\nThey head upstairs, exhausted from the long day of playing.\nDAD (CONT'D)\nRoger, hold on, come here a second.\nRoger comes back downstairs, and Will continues up to their\nroom.\nROGER\nYeah, dad?\nDAD\nI have something I want to give you\nbut I didn't want Will to feel bad.\nROGER\nWhat is it?\nDad takes a small pocketknife out of his pocket, which has a\nmottled wooden handle with two ducks carved on it. He hands\nit to Roger.\nDAD\nIt's called a Barlow knife, and\nthis is the same one that I had as\na kid. It always came in handy for\nme, and I think you're old enough\nto have it now.\nROGER\nWow...thank you!\nDAD\nOf course. Just don't make Will\njealous!\n6.\nROGER\nI won't. We'll carve our names in\nthe treehouse with it, I'll share\nit with him.\nDAD\nPerfect. Just be careful with it,\nit's very sharp!\nROGER\nI will dad. Thank you.\nDAD\nAll right. You better get off to\nbed, then.\nROGER\nYes, dad.\nHe runs upstairs, visibly excited about his gift. Dad fondly\nwatches him go.\nDAD\nI hope he keeps it safe.\nINT. THE BOYS' BEDROOM - NIGHT\nThe light is off, and the two boys lie peacefully in their\nseparate beds. Dad opens the door and peeks his head in.\nDAD\nGood night, boys, I love you.\nWILL\nI love you too dad.\nROGER\nI love you too dad.\nHe leaves, and the two boys lie awake in the dark.\nROGER\nLet's keep working on the treehouse\ntomorrow.\nWILL\nYeah. Can I bring my trains up\nthere?\nROGER\nSure. It can be our little\nhideaway.\nWILL\nHey Roger?\n7.\nROGER\nYeah?\nWILL\nI was thinking... wouldn't it be\nneat if someday we met John\nBarleycorn?\nROGER\n(yawning)\nHe's not real Will.\nWILL\nI bet he is real.\nROGER\nWell, you still believe in the\ntooth fairy.\nWILL\nI do not, Roger, I know dad put the\nquarters under my pillow.\nROGER\nThen why do you still keep them on\nthe night stand?\nWILL\nJust cause dad was the one who put\nthem there doesn't mean they aren't\nmagic. I know they're good luck, at\nleast.\nROGER\nSee what I mean? You believe\neverything. John Barleycorn is not\nreal, Will.\nWILL\nI dunno. I just think it'd be neat\nis all. Roger?\nROGER\nYeah?\nWILL\nDo you miss mom?\nROGER\nYeah.\n8.\nWILL\nMe too. But I can't remember her\nvery well, is that bad?\nROGER\nNo Will, it's all right. Go to\nsleep.\nWILL\nGood night Roger.\nROGER\nGood night Will.\nThe boys fall asleep. Crickets and tree frogs create a\nsymphony of chirping outside in the hot summer night.\nFADE IN.\nINT. A DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT\nIt is a few hours after the boys have fallen asleep. Will\nlies peacefully in his bed, but Roger tosses and turns in the\ngrips of a vivid dream.\nSLOW ZOOM - ROGER\nINT. A RUSTIC BEDROOM - DAY - ROGER'S DREAM\nRoger is lying on a straw-filled mattress in a very oldfashioned room, reminiscent of something you would find in a\nMidwestern farmhouse during the 1930s. Everything seems to be\nslightly out of focus. Morning light streams in through a\nsingle window. A wooden chair stands in the corner. Suddenly,\na gritty, wizened old voice speaks to Roger from the doorway.\nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\nWake up, Roger.\nRoger wakes from his slumber (within the dream) with a start.\nHe sits up to see a man in his fifties standing in the\ndoorway. He is dressed in the garb of a farmer from the early\n20th century: a brimmed hat, denim overalls and a dusty\ncotton shirt. White stubble covers his face like freshly\nfallen snow. It is JOHN BARLEYCORN, in human form.\nJOHN BARLEYCORN\nCome with me, I want to show you\nsomething.\n9.\nJohn leaves the room, and Roger silently gets up to follow.\nThey go outside.\nEXT. THE PRAIRIE - AN OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY\nJohn leads Roger out of the house, which looks remarkably\nsimilar to the one he left behind in real life. However, the\nland is dry and barren. The pond out front has dried up, and\nthe garden is nothing more than a patch of sunbaked dirt.\nClouds of dust blow across a field in the distance. The same\nforest lies a little ways beyond, but the trees are parched\nand lifeless. John is already walking towards the trees, and\nhe motions for Roger to follow.\nINT. THE BOYS' BEDROOM - NIGHT\nWill wakes up, disturbed by the commotion of Roger getting\nout of bed. He looks over and immediately notices that he is\nmissing. Fully awake now, he gets out of bed and looks out\nthe window. The yard is bathed in moonlight, and it reflects\neerily off the pond. Suddenly, Will notices the small figure\nof Roger just beyond. Out of the corner of his eye, he\ncatches a glimpse of a tall, shadowy figure at the edge of\nthe forest, but as quickly as he notices it, the man recedes\nfrom view. Instinctively, Will grabs a small toy train from\nhis nightstand. It is his security object, a sacred good luck\ncharm. Still wearing his pajamas, he dashes downstairs and\noutside to follow Roger.\nEXT. THE FOREST - NIGHT\nWill treads softly a little ways off behind Roger, who\nsleepwalks ahead of him through the dark forest.\nWILL\n(hissed whisper)\nRoger!\nRoger turns around to face Will, but he does not wake up.\nWILL (CONT'D)\nRoger what are you doing, wake up!\nRoger's slumber is far too deep for Will to shake him from\nit. John has put a sort of dream spell on him. He turns away\nfrom Will and continues deeper into the forest. Will moves\nafter him, but suddenly the same tall, shadowy figure steps\nout next to Roger. Will gasps and ducks behind a tree,\nterrified.\n10.\nEXT. THE PRAIRIE - DAY - ROGER'S DREAM\nRoger turns away from the sound, back towards John who is\nwalking a few steps ahead of him.\nROGER\n(dreamily)\nWhat was that?\nJOHN BARLEYCORN\nPay no mind, my young friend, it\nwas nothing at all. Just the wind.\nCome here, I want you to have a\nlook at this tree.\nRoger hesitantly approaches a tree that John is motioning\ntowards.\nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT\nWill watches as the shadow man points at a tree, and his\nsleepwalking brother walks towards it. It is a large, dead\noak tree, with a gaping hole in the side.\nJOHN BARLEYCORN\nLook inside.\nRoger peers inside the tree trunk. He sees a swirling blue\npool of light, glistening with kaleidoscope images. Glimpses\nof scenery flash by - a cat running along a fence, a pretty\ngirl riding a bicycle, a bouquet of flowers being picked. He\nis enchanted, and leans in for a closer look.\nROGER\n(talking in his sleep)\nWow... what is that?\nJOHN BARLEYCORN\nIt is a doorway, Roger. It leads to\na land of opportunity, a land of\nwonder. It's a place where you can\ndo anything you want.\nRoger continues to stare, mystified.\nJOHN BARLEYCORN (CONT'D)\nStep through it with me and all\nyour wildest dreams will come\ntrue...\n11.\nRoger, hypnotized by the portal and completely under John's\npower, begins to climb through the hole and into the tree.\nWill sees Roger climbing into the tree. He runs up to him and\nshakes his shoulders, pulling him back from the hole just in\ntime.\nWILL\nRoger, wait, stop!\nIt is enough to shake Roger from his dream, and he steps back\nfrom the tree. He rubs his eyes and looks around in a daze.\nROGER\nWill! What's going on?\nWILL\nYou were sleepwalking, I followed\nyou out here.\nROGER\n(bewildered)\nOh..\nWILL\nCome on, we have to go back inside.\nThey go back in the house, and Roger gets in bed, where he\nimmediately falls back asleep. Will lies awake though, and\nafter a minute he quietly gets up and tiptoes back outside.\nEXT. THE TREE - NIGHT\nWill walks up to the tree, his toy train clutched firmly in\nhand. He looks into the hole, and see the same blue portal\nthat Roger saw in his dream - it is real. Will looks deeply\ninto it and is hypnotized. The voice of John Barleycorn seems\nto emanate directly from the depths of the pool of light.\nJOHN BARLEYCORN (O.C.)\nI can make all your wildest dreams\ncome true...\nWill is completely entranced. As he stares in, his fingers\nloosen and the toy train drops to the ground - he does not\nnotice. Barely even hesitating, he climbs into the hole and\ndrops into the portal, vanishing without a trace. The only\nsign is his train, which lies forgotten at the foot of the\ntree.\n12.\nEXT. THE BLUE VORTEX\nShouting with excitement, Will tumbles through the air as a\nmist of blue swirls all around him, gently buffeting him\nabout like a leaf falling from a tree. As he falls, he\nreaches out with his fingers and makes trails in the cloud\nnext to him. He giggles happily, and practices a few\nsomersaults in mid air.\nLooking down, he notices that the vortex is beginning to\ntwist and curve, forming a sort of slide. He glides along on\nthe mist, spinning all around and having the time of his\nlife. Scenery below him starts to come into focus, and he\ngradually is able to make out fields, a dirt road, and a\nfarmhouse. The blue mist thins out, and the ground rushes up\nto meet him. Will shouts, this time in fear, and closes his\neyes. When he opens them however, he finds that he has landed\ngently on the ground. He blinks his eyes and looks around.\nA little ways down the road, he can see the house bathed in\nsunshine. Off in the distance to the left, there is a grimlooking forest full of leafless trees. He begins to head down\nthe road.\nEXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY\nWill climbs over the small fence that separates the house\nfrom the road, and circles around to the back. He notices a\nsmall window in the back of the house, hidden from view of\nthe field by a brick chimney. He walks over to it, and cups\nhis ear. Three men are in the kitchen having a conversation.\nMAN #1\nHe was supposed to come through an\nhour ago. Where could he possibly\ngo but here?\nMAN #2\nSomething's wrong. He didn't make\nit through.\nMAN #3\nJohn said he would, and so we wait.\nMAN #2\nI don't like it.\n13.\nMAN #1\nMaybe there was some kind of delay.\nHe has to be careful, tread\nlightly. It's a different world\nover there.\nWill notices an old wooden crate underneath the window, and\nhe places it underneath as a step. He climbs up in order to\nget a better listening post.\nMAN #2\nAnd how long until we go and tell\nhim there is no boy?\nMAN #3\nRelax, Daniel. He's going to fall\nright in our lap.\nWill stands on his tiptoes to try and get even closer, but at\nthat moment the crate gives way and he collapses in a heap\nbeneath the window. He coughs and gets up to his knees,\ndusting himself off. A door slams. Steps approach. He begins\nto look up, and notices three ominously tall shadows suddenly\ntaking position around him. He turns around with a start. The\nthree men are standing over him with their arms crossed.\nMAN #1\nWell, hello there.\nINT. THE BOYS' BEDROOM - DAY\nSun streams in through the window, and birds chirp outside.\nRoger wakes up and stretches, ready to start the day.\nHowever, his excitement quickly turns to confusion - he flips\nback the sheets, to reveal his bare feet caked with mud and\ndirt. He looks over to Will's bed - the covers are thrown\nback, and he is nowhere to be seen.\nROGER\nOh no...\nHe rushes downstairs, then walks through the different rooms\nof the house as he searches for his brother with increasing\ndesperation.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nWill, where are you? This isn't\nfunny...\nFinding no sign of him anywhere downstairs, he goes outside.\n14.\nEXT. THE FOREST - DAY\nRoger walks through the forest, desperately scanning for any\nsign. He recognizes the tree a little ways in the distance\nand dashes over. He kneels at the foot of the tree, looking\nfor some sort of clue. After a moment, he spots something -\nWill's toy train, lying forgotten on the ground. Swallowing\nhard, he gets up slowly and peers over the edge of the hole.\nThe portal is there, still as enchantingly beautiful as the\nnight before. Nervously, he touches it with his fingertips,\nbut recoils quickly. He examines his fingers with a strange\nlook, as if they had just been separated from his body. He\ndashes back to the house.\nINT. THE KITCHEN\nRoger has changed out of his pajamas into slightly more\nadventurous attire, and he busies himself in the kitchen,\nthrowing together some peanut butter sandwiches. He wraps\nthem and stuffs them into a small knapsack. We see that it\nalso contains a compass and binoculars. He checks to make\nsure that the Barlow knife is in his pocket. He slings the\npack over his shoulder, and quietly walks upstairs to his\nfather's room.\nTHE BOYS' ROOM\nRoger grabs the two quarters that Will keeps on his night\nstand (for good luck, of course).\nDAD'S BEDROOM\nRoger opens the door just enough to look in on his dad, who\nis sleeping peacefully. He closes the door.\nEXT. THE FOREST - DAY\nRoger troops back out to the tree, his backpack on his\nshoulder, the toy train gripped firmly in his hand. He looks\nback at the house, which appears peaceful and safe. With grim\ndetermination, he continues towards the tree, and climbs over\nthe edge of the hole without a word. Roger plunges into the\nblue spiral, vanishing exactly as Will did. He tumbles\nthrough space and time with his eyes squeezed shut, but after\na moment he is able to open them, and is astonished by the\ncurrent of blue effervescence that swirls about his body. The\nground rushes up at him, and he closes his eyes to await the\nimpact. But again, like Will, he finds that he has landed\nsafely on the ground.\n15.\nEXT. A WINDSWEPT DIRT ROAD - DAY\nThe lifeless, brown prairies of a dustbowl. Dried out land\nstretches along an endless dirt road lined with barbed wire\nfencing. The landscape is dotted with dried up trees and\nbushes, and it is clear that life is scarce. Roger\nimmediately notices the old farmhouse in the distance, and\nchecks his compass. It shows east, and he turns around to\nface the horizon in the west, facing away from the house. The\nroad stretches off into endlessness, where strange gray\nclouds hover above the horizon. He puts it back in his pocket\nand begins to head down the road to the farmhouse.\nEXT. THE PORCH\nRoger arrives at the front porch of the house, where rickety\nwooden stairs lead up to a screen door. He goes inside.\nINT. THE HOUSE\nHe looks around apprehensively. He is standing in a small\nkitchen, and through an opening on the right a modest living\nroom is visible. He looks upstairs and sees bedroom doors\nlining the second floor landing. In the kitchen there is a\ntable with three chairs and three places set. Some baskets of\nvegetables sit in the corner near an old iron stove attached\nto the wall. Some rusty farm tools are leaning next to it.\nROGER\n(nervously)\nHello? Is there anyone here?\nHe moves further into the kitchen, towards a small window\nthat looks out onto a large field of barley behind the house.\nThrough it, he can see three men working in the field with\nscythes. They wear brimmed hats, overalls, and ragged cotton\nshirts.\nEXT. THE FIELD\nRoger stands by the edge of the swaying barley.\nROGER\nUm.. Hi!\nThe men instantly look up from their work with hawk-like\nquickness.\n16.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nI need some help, I think I'm lost!\nI... don't know where I am.\nThe men speak amongst themselves for a moment, and then\nstride purposefully towards Roger. It is NATHAN, ISAAC, and\nDANIEL, the same three men we last saw with Will. Nathan is\ntall, with a thick brown beard. He stands in the center, and\nappears clearly as the leader of the group. Isaac and Daniel\nstand slightly behind him, looking wary. They look Roger over\nwith unusually keen interest.\nNATHAN\nWhat's your name, son?\nROGER\nRoger.\nNATHAN\nI'm Nathan. These are my brothers\nIsaac and Daniel.\nROGER\nBut... where am I?\nNATHAN\nThis is our farm. Come inside,\nmaybe I can answer some of your\nquestions.\nINT. THE KITCHEN\nNathan, Isaac, and Daniel are clearly exhausted from a hard\nday of work, and the scythes weigh heavily on their\nshoulders. They rest them on the wall and take their hats\noff, then take their seats at the table. Nathan drags an\nextra chair over to the table with his foot and motions for\nRoger to sit.\nNATHAN\nHave a seat, son.\nRoger reluctantly does so.\nNATHAN (CONT'D)\nNow, from the looks of you I'd say\nyou're a long way from home. Why\ndon't we start with how you got\nhere.\n17.\nROGER\nWell, I guess it started with this\ndream I had. I found a tree with a\nbig hole in it, and there was a\npool of swirling light inside. I\nwent out this morning and it was\nstill there, so I climbed through\nand now... here I am. The thing is,\nmy little brother, Will... he went\nthrough first, and now I don't know\nwhere he is. I have to find him,\nmaybe you've seen him?\nThe men glance at each other, then back at Roger.\nISAAC\nWhat does your brother look like?\nROGER\nHe's eight years old, with brown\nhair and blue eyes. I think he's\nwearing his pajamas, that's what he\nmust have been wearing when he went\nthrough. They have trains on them.\nHave you seen him?\nNATHAN\nNo, no.. we haven't seen anyone.\nHardly anyone ever comes here. Just\nthe three of us. Roger, how old are\nyou?\nROGER\nI'm eleven.\nNATHAN\nStrange...\nROGER\nCan you help me find him?\nDANIEL\nWell, this is a big place. It's\nhard to say if he even could be\nfound. We wouldn't know where to\nlook.\nISAAC\nAlthough, there is a train that\nruns by not far from here. Maybe he\njumped on a boxcar, in which case\nhe would be going east.\n18.\nROGER\n(confused)\nBut, why would he do that? He's\nvery little, and if the train isn't\nfar from here, why wouldn't he have\nseen your farm and come looking for\nhelp?\nNATHAN\n(abruptly)\nWe have a room you can stay in\nupstairs, Roger. You must be\nexhausted, you should rest.\nROGER\nOkay. But I have to find him...\nNathan leads him upstairs as Isaac and Daniel pack their\npipes in the kitchen.\nINT. BEDROOM - DAY\nNathan leads Roger into a small bedroom, furnished only by a\nmirror, a wooden chair, and a bed with a straw-filled\nmattress. Thoroughly exhausted, Roger sits down on the bed.\nNathan quietly leaves the room, shutting the door gently\nbehind him. Roger looks out his window at the prairie, where\nlong shadows are cast by the setting sun. He takes off his\nshoes and lays down on the bed, quickly falling asleep.\nINT. A DUNGEON - NIGHT - ROGER'S DREAM\nA dusty hallway with hay strewn about on the floor. The\ncorridor is lined with prison cells. Roger sees himself\nwalking down the hallway in slow motion. He gets to the last\ncell on the right, and turns to see a young boy behind the\nbars. His head is in his hands and we hear him sobbing\nquietly.\nROGER\nWill?\nThe boy looks up, but his face is nothing but a swirling\ncloud of brown dust.\nINT. ROGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nRoger awakens with a gasp.\n19.\nThe room is completely dark except for the pale glow of the\nharvest moon, which casts its light through the single-pane\nwindow. Eerie shadows dance around the room. Muffled voices\ndrift up through the floor, and he realizes he can hear the\nmen talking. After a moment of trying to make out what they\nare saying, he quietly gets out of bed and steps onto the\nfloor. He presses his ear to a small crack, and is able to\nhear their conversation quite clearly. The three of them are\nsitting in the kitchen, smoking pipes and pouring glasses of\nliquor from a bottle on the table.\nINT. KITCHEN\nDANIEL\nI think we should bring him\ntonight. This could be the answer\nthat we've been waiting for.\nNATHAN\nWe've already brought him one boy,\nisn't that enough?\nDANIEL\nBut think if we brought him two!\nThe reward would be... substantial.\nISAAC\nHe's right. If we came to John a\nday later with another healthy boy,\nit would practically guarantee a\nfull harvest this year.\nDANIEL\nIt's an opportunity we can't afford\nto miss. After all, he just fell in\nour lap! They both did. Did you\nforget that John intended that to\nhappen? The first one, at least.\nISAAC\nExactly. He'll be surprised by a\nsecond.\nNATHAN\nWell... all right. We'll take him\nin the morning. Let the poor boy\nget some rest tonight, he's going\nto need it.\n20.\nINT. ROGER'S BEDROOM\nRoger leaps up, his breath quick, near panic. He scurries\nback into bed as he hears the heavy sound of boot steps\ncoming up the stairs. He pulls the covers over himself just\nin time. Nathan opens the door to check on him, but he\nsucceeds in pretending to be asleep. Satisfied, Nathan\nleaves, and the men retire to their separate rooms. Complete\nsilence settles over the house. Roger walks softly to the\ndoor, carrying his shoes so as not to make any noise. He\nlistens at the door, then gently tries the handle. The door\nopens and he steps out into the hall. Being ever so careful\nto avoid any creaking, he makes his way downstairs, and opens\nthe screen door which leads out onto the front porch.\nHe shuts the door slowly to prevent it from banging, and then\nhe turns and slips on his shoes. He leaps off the porch,\nalready running.\nEXT. THE ROAD - NIGHT\nHe hits the ground running and takes off full-speed down the\ndusty moonlit road. The farmhouse is left behind, looming\nominously in the night. We follow Roger on his run down the\nroad, and he does not stop until the farmhouse is well out of\nsight. He stops a moment to catch his breath. As his\nbreathing slows, he notices a slight rumble in the ground,\ngradually getting louder. He approaches a ridge a little ways\nahead. The rumbling continues to gain volume, and he climbs\nto the top of the ridge. Below lie train tracks, and a train\nmoving briskly along. All he can see are boxcars.\nRoger runs down to where the ground meets the tracks and runs\nalongside the train. He catches up to the side of a boxcar,\nand tosses his knapsack onboard. A moment later he is able to\ngrab on and pull himself up into the car.\nINT. AN (ALMOST) EMPTY BOXCAR\nRoger collapses on the dusty floor, quite out of breath. A\nman's voice comes out of the darkness.\nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\nWhat's this? A boy? How strange!\nRoger gasps and looks up. A large black crow steps out of the\nshadows. Roger is stunned, and tries to form words but\nnothing comes out. Before him stands PERCY, a talking crow.\n21.\nPERCY\nDon't worry, you have nothing to\nfear from me, I'm just an old bird.\nMy name is Percy.\nRoger pushes himself off the floor and sits back against the\nwall. He stares in disbelief at the bird.\nROGER\nYou scared me.\nPERCY\nThat's funny, I don't feel like a\nscarecrow today.\nROGER\nDo you live here?\nPERCY\nOh, I just ride the train, watching\nthe prairie roll by. Sometimes I\nrun into fellow travelers, but they\nare few and far between.\nROGER\nWhere does this go?\nPERCY\nTo the East. There's an old woman\nwho lives out there that I need to\nsee. She's the only one who can\nhelp me fly again.\nROGER\nYou can't fly?\nPERCY\nThat's why I ride the train. I used\nto be able to.\nROGER\nWhat happened?\nPercy wistfully looks off into the night.\nPERCY\nWell... I made a mistake. I had to\nbe taught a lesson.\n22.\nEXT. A CATTLE PEN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK\nTwo small calves lie curled up in the hay of their pen,\nsleeping soundly. Percy is perched on the corner of an\naluminum shed attached to the side of the pen, and he watches\nover the two animals.\nPERCY (V.O.)\nA long time ago, I worked for a\nfarmer who had just received two\nnewborn calves as a gift. He\nreceived them as a reward for a\nseason of hard work. They were\nbeautiful creatures, both of them\nwere pure white. I was responsible\nfor watching them. Coyotes come out\nat night around here, and I was\nsupposed to send up warning if any\nshould come near.\nA full moon shines brightly above the scene, and Percy looks\nabout. Then, in a flutter of motion, he leaves his perch on\nand flies off into the night, leaving the calves unattended.\nPERCY (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nI love...er, I loved to fly. I\nhated standing still, and it was\nsuch a beautiful night, with the\nfull moon and everything. So I took\noff, just to stretch my wings a\nbit.\nEXT. THE WILD PRAIRIE\nPercy flies over the scenery, and he swoops low to weave\nthrough the trees. He closes his eyes with pleasure as he\neffortlessly glides through the air.\nEXT. THE CATTLE PEN\nTwo menacing coyotes sneak up to the pen, and they manage to\nundo the latch on the gate. The calves sleep on, completely\noblivious to their imminent demise. The coyotes snarl, and\npounce on their unsuspecting prey.\nPERCY (V.O.)\nI was only gone for a few minutes,\nbut when I got back they had come\nand...it was far too late.\n23.\nEXT. AN OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY\nPercy stands outside of a house on the front porch. We see\nthe back of a man dressed in the same attire that John\nBarleycorn was wearing in Roger's dream, though we do not see\nhis face. He towers over Percy, who trembles with fear in his\nshadow. The man bends over to pick him up, and holds him\ngently in his hands.\nPERCY (V.O.)\nThose calves were a gift from a\nvery powerful man. He was greatly\ndispleased that I allowed them to\nbe destroyed. When I told him what\nhappened, he decided that I didn't\ndeserve to fly anymore.\nThe man runs a long, gnarled finger down Percy's spine as he\nlies helpless in his grasp. He touches each one of his wings,\nand then sets him down on the ground. Wind swirls across the\nfields, and Percy hops about, flapping his wings uselessly.\nPERCY (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nThat man's name was John\nBarleycorn.\nWe then see Barleycorn's face, the same face that Roger saw\nin his dream. He smiles slyly, and turns to go back inside.\nPercy hops down off the porch and up to the road, leaving the\nhouse behind.\nINT. THE BOXCAR - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY\nROGER\nYou mean... John Barleycorn is a\nreal person?\nPERCY\nOh, he's real. And like I said, he\nis very powerful. Where were you\nrunning from?\nROGER\nThese strange men...there were\nthree men that I met. When I got\nhere, I saw their house and I went\nto it looking for help.\nPERCY\nFar from home, are you?\n24.\nHe nods.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nI could tell. Those men are\nprobably the last people that I\nwould go to for help.\nROGER\nWell, I overheard them talking. I\nthink they took my little brother,\nWill, to John Barleycorn. I don't\nknow why though.\nPERCY\nYour little brother... are you\npositive?\nROGER\nYes, I'm sure it was him. That's\nwhy I ran away, they were going to\ntake me too.\nPERCY\nAh, this is very bad. Those three\nmen, they work for John. I'm sure\nyou're right, the question is, what\ndoes he want with your brother?\nROGER\nI don't know, I just have to get\nhim back.\nPERCY\nI think you need to come see a\nfriend of mine, the old woman that\nI mentioned. Her name is Mother\nFlorence, and I think she may be\nable to help you, too.\nEXT. THE LINE OF BOXCARS\nThe cars chug along the track through the night, disappearing\nover the horizon. Roger and Percy sit by the opening on the\nside, looking out over the prairie.\nEXT. THE FARM - DAY\nNATHAN (O.C.)\nHe's gone.\n25.\nINT. ROGER'S BEDROOM\nNathan stands in the doorway to Roger's bedroom. Isaac and\nDaniel crowd around the doorway behind him with looks of\ndisbelief on their faces.\nNATHAN\n(grimly)\nJohn will need to know about this.\nImmediately.\nEXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAY\nNathan, Isaac, and Daniel approach the door, and Nathan\nknocks rather meekly. After a beat John Barleycorn himself\nopens the door. He looks at them with disdain, as if he\nalready knows what they are going to tell him.\nJOHN\nWell, come in.\nINT. JOHN'S HOUSE\nThe inside of the house is sparsely decorated. There is a\nmain dining hall, with a fireplace off to the side. The\nkitchen lies a little ways beyond.\nDINING HALL\nJohn sits at the head of the table, and he motions for the\nthree other men to take a seat as well.\nJOHN\n(wearily)\nNow, what is it you've come to see\nme about?\nNATHAN\nAnother boy came to our house. We\nthink it's the one you were after.\nOriginally.\nJOHN\nAnd you have him, I trust?\nNATHAN\nWe...ah...we lost him. In the\nmiddle of the night he ran off. He\nmust have heard us talking. We were\ntalking about his brother.\n26.\nJohn stands up in anger, looking down wrathfully upon the\nthree men. They cower under his gaze.\nJOHN\nYou...lost...him?!\nNATHAN\nBut we can find him again! We will\nfind him and bring him here to you\nand... think about it John, let us\nfind him.\nJOHN\nForget it, I can't trust you idiots\nwith anything.\nJohn sits back down, his brow furrowed with worry.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nHe could be anywhere now, you know.\nYou three would never be able to\ntrack him down. I'll need someone\nelse to find him.\nNATHAN\nBut John, we did bring you the\nyounger one, doesn't that mean\nanything?\nJOHN\nYou fools, I delivered him right to\nyou, all you had to do was bring\nhim here. Same with the other one,\nbut you couldn't handle that. No, I\nneed men who are slightly more\ncompetent.\nNathan looks deeply offended.\nNATHAN\nWhat are you going to do now?\nJOHN\nI'm calling my Rangers.\nEXT. A WIDE EXPANSE OF PRAIRIE - DAY\nSomewhere in the wilderness beyond John's farmhouse. Two men,\nLUTHER and MARTIN, are riding white horses at full gallop\nacross the field. They race each other at breakneck speed,\nurging their horses faster and faster.\n27.\nThey are extremely large, as are their horses, and they look\nlike they could pick someone up and toss them through the\nair. They are dressed in the uniform of workers for the Pony\nExpress - trousers, cotton shirts, leather vests, bandanas,\nwide-brimmed cowboy hats, and six-shooters slung in hip\nholsters. They ride across the plain and John's farmhouse\ncomes into view. They gallop towards it, whooping and\nshouting as they approach. Soon they arrive, where they find\nJohn waiting outside by the garden with Nathan.\nJOHN\nGood day, gentlemen.\nLUTHER\nHowdy, boss. It's a hot one out\nthere today.\nJOHN\nNathan, these are my Rangers.\nLuther, and Martin.\nNathan squints up at them nervously. Their spurs glint in the\nhot sun.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nWell boys I'll get straight to the\npoint. The imbecile you see\nstanding beside me is responsible\nfor the loss of a very important\nasset, which happens to belong to\nme.\nThe two Rangers look at Nathan as if he is a bug.\nMARTIN\nWhat'd he lose, boss?\nJOHN\nA boy.\nLUTHER\nA boy?\nJOHN\nI have his younger brother. I\nwouldn't have called on you two if\nthis wasn't a matter of the utmost\nimportance. But I need him brought\nto me. Unharmed.\nLuther and Martin look at each other, considering the task at\nhand.\n28.\nLUTHER\nYou got it, boss.\nJOHN\nGood. Now, Nathan here thinks he\nhopped on board a train headed\neast, towards Mother Florence's\ncamp. Sounds like a pretty good tip\nto me.\nMARTIN\nWhat's he look like?\nJOHN\nHe's eleven years old, a young boy\nwith brown hair. He's the only\nother child in this place, I should\nthink he'd be pretty unmistakable.\nMARTIN\nWe'll find him.\nJOHN\nYou will be richly rewarded, of\ncourse. Now go!\nThe two horsemen ride into the distance, off in pursuit of\nRoger.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nI suggest you gather your things\nand go home before I lose my\ntemper. You have tried my patience\nenough for one day.\nWithout a word, Nathan goes back inside and tells Isaac and\nDaniel that it is time to go. They march along down the road\nback in the direction of their house, hanging their heads\ndejectedly. He glares after them from the front porch, and\nturns to go back inside. He slams the screen door behind him.\nEXT. THE TRAIN - DAY\nThe train continues to move steadily through the prairie, a\nlarge plume of smoke coming out of the stack on the engine.\nINT. BOXCAR\nRoger looks out the side of the boxcar, watching the scenery\ndrift by.\n29.\nHe looks into the knapsack to see if there are any un-smushed\nsandwiches, but they are completely crushed beyond\nrecognition. He sighs.\nPERCY\nCheer up, Roger, we'll find your\nbrother!\nROGER\nI know, but...I'm really hungry.\nPERCY\nWell, you know, for a crow I have a\nlot of tricks up my sleeve. I\nmanaged to procure some breakfast\nfor us. I knew you would be\nfamished.\nRoger looks over and sees that Percy has produced a large\nloaf of bread, which is sitting neatly on a cloth napkin\nbeside him.\nROGER\n(astonished)\nWhere did you get that?\nPERCY\nBeing able to talk isn't my only\nunusual ability.\nRoger hungrily digs into the bread, tearing off large hunks\nand chewing eagerly. Percy offers him a canteen of water,\nwhich he gulps down.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nThe person we're going to see,\nMother Florence, is a very wise,\nkind old woman. She's going to help\nme fly again, and I'm sure she'll\nknow what to do about your brother.\nROGER\nWhere does she live?\nPERCY\nThere's a small campsite not far\nfrom here where she lives with her\nchildren. We'll be there soon I\nthink.\n30.\nEXT. TRAIN\nIt continues its journey through the wasted landscape, while\nRoger and Percy remain seated on the edge of the boxcar.\nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS - LATER\nThe train tracks run through a gap in the fencing by the side\nof the road. It is the same place that Roger first saw the\ntrain after running away, and the two horsemen calmly trot up\nto inspect the area. Luther hops off his horse, and walks\nslowly up to a patch of earth where Roger's footprints are\nstill visible in the dust. Martin pulls on his reigns, as his\nhorse stamps about restlessly.  Luther scoops up some of the\ndust and tosses it into the wind.\nLUTHER\nHe was just here.\nMARTIN\nHe must'a come straight here after\nhe ran away. Lucky kid, he just\nhappened to wind up at the tracks\nwhen the train was comin' by.\nLUTHER\nYeah, well...maybe luck didn't have\nanything to do with it.\nLuther looks off down the tracks, to the east.\nLUTHER (CONT'D)\nWe'll never catch him if we stay on\nthe tracks. We'll need to take a\nshortcut.\nHe gets up and deftly mounts his horse, spinning her around\ntowards east.\nLUTHER (CONT'D)\nCome on, let's ride!\nThe men gallop off down the road, away from the train tracks.\nThey send up a great plume of dust behind them, and are gone.\nINT. THE THREE BROTHERS' HOUSE - NIGHT\nNathan, Daniel, and Isaac return from their trip to John\nBarleycorn's and morosely troop inside to the kitchen.\n31.\nThey sit down heavily at the table, and Nathan immediately\nbrings out a tobacco pouch and starts packing his pipe.\nDaniel takes a bottle of amber liquid from the center of the\ntable and pours a glass for himself, and then two more for\nhis brothers.\nDANIEL\nWell I don't think that could have\ngone any worse, do you?\nNATHAN\nNope.\nDANIEL\nYou know, every year we play the\nsame game; we do what John wants\nand then he spits on us.\nISAAC\nEver since he brought us over.\nDANIEL\nThat was a long time ago.\nDaniel takes a long draught from his glass.\nDANIEL (CONT'D)\nAnd you know he's just going to do\nthe same thing to those boys. Cut\nthem off from their home, and keep\nthem here forever.\nISAAC\nJust like us.\nNATHAN\nAnd so what do you two\nrevolutionaries propose we do?\nDANIEL\nWhat happens when John dies? All\nhis indentured servants go free,\nforever...\nISAAC\n...and we can live in peace.\nDANIEL\nIsn't it plain to see? We've known\nthis for years Nathan. John\nBarleycorn must die.\nDaniel takes another gulp of his drink.\n32.\nDANIEL (CONT'D)\nHe is pretty old, after all.\nNATHAN\nDon't be foolish, it can't be done.\nDANIEL\nWell, we have to do something!\nNATHAN\nThose boys don't deserve to be kept\nhere like us. No one deserves that.\nISAAC\nIt's true. We missed our chance to\nget home, but maybe we can prevent\nthem from missing theirs.\nNATHAN\nSo what must be done?\nDANIEL\nOnce John opens a portal, it always\ncloses at midnight on that day. If\nwe leave now, we should be able to\nget there in plenty of time.\nNathan taps out his pipe and stands up, ready to go.\nNATHAN\nWell, what are we waiting for?\nWe've got a job to do.\nDANIEL\nWait, there's just one other\nthing...\nHe gets up and goes over to the wall, where the scythes are\nleaning. He picks one up, hefting it easily in his weathered\nhands.\nDANIEL (CONT'D)\nWe're bringing these.\nINT. A DUNGEON - NIGHT\nA short set of stairs leads into a dusty, hay-strewn\ncorridor, lined with prison cells. The dungeon appears to\nhave once been used as a horse barn, but the stalls have had\ntheir gates replaced by formidable iron bars. In a cell on\nthe right we see Will, his tiny hands wrapped around the\nbars. He is quietly weeping.\n33.\nHis cell is not entirely unpleasant, however; a comfortablelooking cot stands off to one side, and a hand-carved wooden\nrocking chair sits in the other corner, next to a stack of\nbooks. In the far corner there is a small water pump, along\nwith a basin.\nSuddenly, a key turns in the door at the top of the stairs.\nWith a loud metallic groan, it opens, and we hear the heavy\nboot steps of a man approaching. Will looks up hopefully and\nsees MANDRAKE, a guard employed by John Barleycorn. He is\nextremely tall and lithe, and wears a thick black moustache.\nHe is dressed in the garb of a Union soldier, ca. 1863, and\nlarge cavalry pistol hangs in a holster on his belt. His\nboots click smartly as he turns to stand in front of Will's\ncell.\nMANDRAKE\nJohn would like you to come\nupstairs for a bit. Would that be\nall right with you, son?\nWill sniffs and looks up at him.\nWILL\nI don't know, mister.. I just want\nto go home.\nMANDRAKE\nThis is home, my boy! John has big\nplans for you. Come on up, he just\nwants to chat. Some new living\nquarters are to be arranged as\nwell.\nWill moves back from the door and allows Mandrake to unlock\nand open it. He steps out into the yellow light of the\ncorridor, and Mandrake claps a hand on his shoulder. They\nbegin to walk down the hall towards the door.\nMANDRAKE (CONT'D)\nYou have to understand, your\ncurrent room was just a precaution.\nWILL\nI miss my dad...\nMANDRAKE\n(ignoring the comment)\nWait until you see our dining hall!\nThey continue up the stairs through the door. It clangs shut\nbehind them, and Mandrake turns the key in the lock with a\nloud crunch.\n34.\nINT. ROGER AND PERCY'S BOXCAR - DAY\nRoger is sleeping on the floor of the car, using his backpack\nas a pillow. A slight bump from the train jostles him awake,\nand he gets up, rubbing his eyes. He looks around for Percy,\nand realizes he is nowhere to be found. A look of panic\nflashes into his eyes, and he looks out from the boxcar,\ndesperately scanning the landscape and the length of the\ntrain for some sign of his friend. Suddenly, a voice calls\nfrom above.\nPERCY (O.S.)\nRoger! Up here!\nRoger looks up to see Percy peering over the side of the\nroof.\nROGER\nWhat are you doing up there?!\nPERCY\nWe have to go see the conductor!\nHe'll make sure we get dropped off\nat Mother Florence's.\nROGER\nConductor?\nPERCY\nWell, of course. Did you think this\ntrain was driving itself?\nROGER\nNo...I guess not.\nPERCY\nCome on, there's a ladder next to\nthe door. Watch your step!\nRoger leans out and sees the rungs attached to the side of\nthe train. He grabs on and begins climbing up. Percy helps\nhim get onto the roof, and he stands up to admire the\npanoramic view. The train stretches out behind them in a\nseemingly endless line, but ahead of them the main cab is\nvisible a few cars off.\nROGER\nWhat else is on this train?\nPercy begins making his way towards the front, and Roger\nfollows.\n35.\nPERCY\n(nonchalant)\nOh, just about everything you could\npossibly imagine. And a few things\nthat you couldn't.\nThe climb across to the next car, and continue marching\nforward to the next one, and the next one. They stop on the\nedge of a green fuel tanker, which has a ladder going down to\na flatbed.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nWe'll have to climb down now, and\nI'm going to take you through these\ncars. Be sure to follow me closely,\nyou'd be surprised at how easy it\nis to get lost in here.\nROGER\n(nervously)\nOkay...\nThey both climb down the ladder, and approach the door to the\nfirst car. It is strangely ornate, painted red.\nPERCY\nNow, Roger, I need you to give\nthree good knocks on that door.\nDon't be shy!\nRoger looks at him somewhat skeptically, but steps forward\nand does as he is asked. A moment after the third knock, the\ndoor cracks open, revealing a sliver of warm, glowing light.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nWell, go on, open it!\nRoger gently pushes the door open, and the light from inside\nspills out over the travelers. A look of wonder is plastered\non Roger's face. He and Percy step forward into the light,\nand the door claps shut behind them.\nEXT. A BEAUTIFUL PASTURE - DAY\nPercy and Roger step out of the doorway into a wide open\nfield of swaying grass. The only evidence of the train is the\ndoor frame behind them, which stands alone in the field,\noddly out of place. The pasture slopes down a hill, and is\nlined on all sides by a wooden fence. Roger looks around in\nwonder and disbelief.\n36.\nROGER\nPercy...where are we?\nPERCY\nOh this is just car #17. Once we\ncross this pasture, we only have to\nget through 18 and 19 before we are\nable to see the conductor. He's in\nnumber twenty.\nROGER\nWhat do you mean, 'get through'?\nPERCY\nWell, you can't exactly stroll\nthrough this place. Do you think\nthe conductor makes special stops\nfor just anybody? Just stay close\nto me and we'll be all right.\nRoger swallows hard, and they proceed forward, wading through\nthe grass. Percy hops about here and there, and he seems to\nbe watching the ground quite closely. Roger wanders off to\nthe side, looking at some exotic-looking flowers that have\nsprung up close to the fence.\nROGER\nHey, Percy, come look at this one!\nRoger stops at a very bright, pink flower that sticks out of\nthe grass, strangely isolated from any of the other flowers.\nHe looks closer, and sees that a pistle extending from the\ncenter of the flower is waving about, appearing to taste the\nair. Percy hops over, a concerned look on his face.\nPERCY\nRoger, come along, you shouldn't go\nnear that.\nROGER\nBut Percy look! It's like it's\nthinking or something.\nPERCY\nRoger we have to keep mov-...!\nAll of a sudden, the earth around the flower begins to\ncrumble and rise as a massive creature heaves up from below.\nThe entire field seems to shake, and clods of dirt fall away\nas a massive mole-like animal emerges, the strange pink\nflower firmly attached to its head. He snaps about blindly\nand viciously, searching for the intruders. Roger and Percy\nstand below, cowering in the shadow of the beast.\n37.\nThey are frozen in place. The creature picks up on their\nscent, and lets out an earth-shaking bellow. It lowers its\nrose-topped head and prepares to charge.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\n(panicking)\nRoger, RUN!!!\nThey both snap out of their trance and turn to sprint across\nthe field in the other direction. It takes off after them,\nfuriously roaring and gnashing its teeth. Percy hops along at\nbreakneck pace, and Roger runs quickly through the swaying\ngrass. Moving along the fence, they look back and see that\ntheir pursuer is loping along at a frightening pace, and is\nquickly gaining ground on the terrified travelers. The pink\nflower on its head appears to be acting as its compass,\nswiveling to stay pointed at Roger and Percy even as they\nduck and weave through the grass.\nRoger and Percy keep going forward, and a short distance\nahead they see that the fence continues on a little further,\nleading straight to another door that looks much the same as\nthe one they entered through. It stands out alone in the\ngrass, apparently not leading anywhere.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nCome on, we're almost there!\nROGER\nI think it's getting closer!!\nPERCY\nJust keep running! Once we get to\nthe exit, we'll be safe!\nThey continue to speed through the grass, and the door grows\never closer. The beast, however, has almost caught up to\nthem. It nips at Roger's heels, and he pumps his young legs\nto muster a little extra speed and stay ahead.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nRoger, look in your pockets, find\nsomething, anything to throw at\nhim!\nRoger is terrified, but he manages to reach into the breast\npocket of his shirt and retrieve his pocketknife. He flips it\nopen, just as the monster lunges forward to try and bite one\nof his legs off. Roger swings out with the knife, scoring a\nsolid hit on the stem of the flower. The animal recoils with\na loud roar of pain and confusion, and the wounded flower\ndroops uselessly across its face. It gives Percy and Roger\nenough time to make it to the door.\n38.\nRoger flings it open, and they collapse onto a platform\nbetween two ordinary looking train cars. The door slams shut\nbehind them.\nROGER\nWhat...was...that thing?\nPERCY\nThat was something that was not\nmeant to be trifled with, my young\nfriend.\nROGER\nBut all I did was look at the\nflower!\nPERCY\nExactly! I told you, it's easier to\nget lost - in more ways than one -\nthan you think. We have to be\ncareful from now on. This train can\nbe dangerous.\nROGER\nPercy, I don't think I like this\ngame.\nPERCY\nIt's no game, Roger. You do want to\nget your brother back, don't you?\nROGER\nOf course!\nPERCY\nAnd you won't give up, no matter\nwhat?\nROGER\nNo matter what.\nPERCY\nWell, so, you know how I feel about\ngetting my wings back. We can't do\nthat unless we get to Mother\nFlorence! Without her help, it\nwould be impossible.\nROGER\nI'm sorry, Percy, I didn't mean to\ncause so much trouble.\n39.\nPERCY\nOh, well... we're both safe, aren't\nwe?\nROGER\nYes.\nPERCY\nRight. So, chin up! We've got to\nkeep moving.\nPercy and Roger catch their breath, then stand to approach\nthe next door.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nJust like before, my friend. Three\ngood knocks, if you please.\nRoger does as he is asked, and once again the door\nmysteriously opens on its own.\nEXT. A LARGE CAVE - NIGHT\nRoger and Percy step out from the doorway onto a stony path\nin the middle of a very large cavern. Stalactites and\nstalagmites jut out from above and below, and the sound of\ndripping water resonates off the limestone walls. Torches\nline the wall alongside the path, and Roger boldly takes one\nout of its holder. Percy winces.\nROGER\nCome on, let's go!\nPERCY\nAh, I'm not sure you should\ntake...never mind, let's go.\nThey proceed on down the path. Soon they are able to hear the\nsound of running water.\nROGER\nWhat is that?\nPERCY\nIt sounds like an underground\nriver. I think we'll be able to see\nit around this corner.\nContinuing forward, the duo round the corner and as\npredicted, a wide running river is flowing along through the\ncave.\n40.\nThe water is dark and churning, with white-capped waves\nappearing here and there. The path turns down and continues\nalong a small ridge a few feet above the water.\nROGER\nSo, if we just follow this path,\nit'll take us to the next door,\nright?\nPERCY\nYes, unless of course we happen\nupon some sort of obstacle. For\nexample...\nPercy's point is illustrated for him as they find the path\nopening up into a clearing by the river, surrounded by solid\nrock walls. Looking across, they can see that the path\ncontinues to wind through the cave a little ways up. The\nriver is wide, and the water is black as ink. A small\nferryboat rests on the shore, but does not appear to be\nattended.\nROGER\nCome on! We can hop in this boat\nand float right to the other shore.\nPERCY\nI don't think that's such a good\nidea, Roger. The water is moving\ntoo fast, we'd go sailing right\npast it and end up who knows where.\nPlus, if I remember correctly, that\nboat belongs to...\nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\nGreetings.\nPercy and Roger whirl around to see CHARON, the ferryman. He\nis dressed in a black robe tied around the waist, and his\nface is extremely pale and aged. He carries a very large\nstaff, long enough to guide the boat through the water.\nROGER\nWho are you?\nCHARON\nI am Charon, the ferryman. I can\ntake you across the river.\nROGER\nReally? That's great! Come on\nPercy, let's get in the boat.\n41.\nCHARON\nWait. First, you must pay the fare.\nROGER\nFare?\nPercy takes Roger aside.\nPERCY\nHe needs coins, Roger. One for each\nof us. We may as well head back\nnow, there's no other way to cross.\nROGER\nBut we have to! You said so\nyourself, if we don't see Mother\nFlorence, I'll never get my brother\nback and you'll never be able to\nfly again!\nPERCY\nI know that Roger, but without the\ncoins we aren't going anywhere.\nROGER\nHold on a minute...\nRoger digs around in his pockets, searching for the quarters\nhe took off the nightstand before he left. He finds them and\nholds them out to Percy.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nOne for each of us, right?\nPERCY\n(amazed)\nWhere did you get those?\nROGER\nI borrowed them...from my brother.\nHe says they're good luck. I didn't\nbelieve him but now... well, we can\nget across can't we?\nPERCY\nYes, I think we can!\nRoger gives one of the coins to Percy, and they confidently\nwalk over to Charon.\nROGER\nTwo for the ferry, please, Mr.\nCharon, sir.\n42.\nWithout a word, he accepts the coins and walks over to the\nferry, stepping in.\nCHARON\nCome along. I will take you across\nnow.\nRoger and Percy get into the boat, and Charon uses his staff\nto push them all the way out into the water. The current\nquickly takes control of the boat, and they begin to move\ndownstream towards the opposite shore. Charon stands at the\nbow, expertly guiding the boat with the pole. He turns it\ntowards the opening of the path, and lands the boat on the\nshore with relative ease despite the speed of the river. It\nrests on the bank with a sandy crunch, and Percy and Roger\nimmediately hop out.\nROGER\nThank you!\nCHARON\nFarewell.\nHe pushes the boat off shore and back out on the river. It\nrapidly carries him downstream, away from where they began.\nROGER\nWhere do you think he's going now?\nPERCY\nI have no idea. Let's get going,\nthis place gives me the creeps.\nThey continue up the path.\nROGER\nPercy, look!\nThere is a wooden door in the stone wall, right where the\npath ends.\nPERCY\nAh ha! We've made it.\nThey hurry down the rest of the path and pull open the door.\nINT. JOHN'S DINING HALL - NIGHT\nJohn Barleycorn is seated at the head of a very long dining\ntable, where two candles burn brightly in their holders. A\nlarge fire roars in the fireplace off to the side.\n43.\nOn the mantle above, there is a large civil war saber mounted\nin its scabbard. John sits stroking his beard, looking\nrelaxed. A door in the corner opens to reveal Mandrake, with\nWill standing behind him.\nMANDRAKE\nYour guest of honor is here, sir.\nJOHN\nAh, wonderful! Bring him in.\nMandrake enters the room with Will trailing behind. He looks\nterrified, and his eyes dart nervously about the room. They\napproach the table, and Mandrake motions for Will to take a\nseat at the corner, next to John. He sits down obediently,\nbut hangs his head, not looking at anyone. Mandrake stands\noff to the side at attention.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nWell, how are you my boy? I must\napologize for your current\nquarters, I didn't want you to run\naway. But you wouldn't do that,\nyou're a good boy, aren't you?\nWill looks up at him and nods his head.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nOf course. I knew you were. We're\ngoing to put you in a much more\ncomfortable room tonight. But I'm\nbeing rude; do you know what my\nname is?\nWill shakes his head, no.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nThat's all right, I'll tell you. My\nname is John Barleycorn, and this\nwhole place...belongs to me. The\nfields, the trees, the sky.\nEverything, really.\nWILL\n(confused)\nYou can't own the sky.\nJOHN\nOh, but I can. I own it like you\nown a small toy train, for example.\nIt's just another one of my\nplaythings. Incidentally, I also\nown a real train, but it's still\njust a toy.\n44.\n(MORE)\nIt could all be yours Will, that's\nwhy I've brought you here, you see?\nYou'll live with me, and have a\nbrand new room, and you'll be able\nto do anything you want.\nWILL\nI like it in my own room, with\nRoger. I just want to go home.\nJOHN\nWith Roger, did you say?\nWILL\nHe's my brother, I know he's coming\nto find me.\nJOHN\nHm.. That very well may be. But\nwouldn't you like it, Will, if\nRoger could live here with you,\ntoo? Then you'd never have to go\nhome.\nWILL\nNo! I don't like it here.\nJOHN\nCome now, son, it's not all bad. I\nthink you'll come to love it, in\nfact.\nWill hangs his head again, defeated.\nWILL\nWhy are you keeping me here?\nJOHN\nKeeping you? I wouldn't put it that\nway but...it will take some\nexplaining.\nJohn gets up from the table and heads to another door, behind\nthe head of the table.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nCome here, I want to show you\nsomething.\nWill stands up and shuffles over to the door. John claps a\nhand on his shoulder and they disappear into the room.\n45.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nINT. THE CHAMBER OF THE CRYSTAL BALL - NIGHT\nWill and John are standing in a dimly lit chamber, in the\nmiddle of which stands a large glowing orb. They move closer,\nand see that milky clouds are swirling about in a frenzy,\nemitting small white flashes of light. Will stares in\namazement.\nWILL\nWhat is that?\nJOHN\nIt is what I use to see around this\nplace. I can't be everywhere at\nonce, you know. Look closer, tell\nme what you see.\nWill does as he is told, and the clouds appear to separate.\nThe plains come into view, and then the train itself,\nrumbling along through the landscape. He looks closer. The\nball shows him a much more detailed view of the train, and\nthen even closer on the platform between two cars positioned\nclose to the front. Will can now make out his brother and\nPercy, now sitting up and talking animatedly. He gasps.\nWILL\nRoger!\nJohn quickly comes around to where Will is standing, and\nlooks closely.\nJOHN\nWhat, what is it? Do you see your\nbrother?\nWILL\nYes! And he's talking to...a bird!\nJOHN\n(muttering)\nThen it's just as I suspected.\nThey're going to Mother Florence's.\nWILL\nThey're getting up! I think they're\ngoing into that traincar.\nJOHN\nYes, yes, of course, they have to.\nYou'll have to excuse me son, I\nhave to go attend to something.\n46.\n(MORE)\nWait right here, I won't be a\nminute.\nWill hardly even hears him. John leaves the room, while he\ncontinues to stare at the crystal ball which only shows the\ntrain rolling along the tracks. Roger and Percy have\ndisappeared into the second car, and Will waits for some sign\nof them on the other side.\nINT. A PRIVATE ROOM IN JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\nJohn sits in a large, old-fashioned easy chair in a small,\nprivate smoking room. A lamp stands by his side, and a pipe\nand ashtray are on a small table below it. He is wearing a\npair of reading glasses, and writes quickly but carefully\nwith a fountain pen on a piece of parchment.\nINSERT - THE NOTE, which reads:\n\"The boy and Percy are headed for\nMother Florence. They MUST NOT make\ncontact with her. Intercept the\ntravelers, or take care of Flo - I\nleave it in your hands. It is\nIMPERATIVE that you do not fail!\"\nJohn signs the letter with his first name, and carefully\nrolls up the piece of parchment. He then ties it with a thin\npiece of string, and places it on the table next to him. John\nstands up from his chair, and walks out of frame towards the\ncamera. We hear the metallic sound of a cage being opened,\nand a clamorous rustling of wings. John walks back to his\nchair with a beautiful peregrine falcon perched on his arm.\nThis is John's beloved pet, XERXES. He takes the rolled up\nnote and ties it carefully to one of the falcon's legs.\nJOHN\nI need this delivered right away,\nXerxes, do you hear me?\nAmazingly, the bird nods its head.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nGood. You know who to bring it to.\nJohn quickly walks outside through the screen door on his\nporch, and with a wave of his arm Xerxes is launched into the\nair, beating his wings and twisting off into the night sky.\nAfter he has flown off, John turns to go back inside the\nhouse.\n47.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nINT. THE CHAMBER OF THE CRYSTAL BALL - NIGHT\nJohn enters the room to find Will still staring perplexedly\nat the ball.\nJOHN\nI'm back, son. What do you see now?\nWILL\nI don't know, they went inside and\nI haven't seen them since.\nJOHN\nLet me show you something else,\nthen.\nJohn waves a hand over the ball, and clouds and lights swirl\nabout, obscuring the image of the train. After a moment the\nball clears, revealing a new image. It is a massive field of\nwheat, with peasants dotted about, working hard under the\nsun.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nYou see all those people?\nWILL\nYes.\nJOHN\nAt this very moment, those people\nand hundreds more just like them,\nare working for me.\nWILL\nWhat do you mean?\nJOHN\nThese fields, this land...it's all\nmine, Will. If those people out\nthere do a good job, I make sure\nthey get fed. But I can't do it by\nmyself.\nWILL\nWhy not?\nJOHN\nI'm getting old, I can't keep track\nof things like I used to. My\nkingdom is rather large, you see.\n48.\nWILL\nOh..\nJOHN\nBut once you get to know the place,\nit doesn't feel so big. When you've\nlived here as long as I have, it\ncan seem kind of small in a way. Do\nyou see what I mean?\nWILL\nYeah, I guess so..\nJOHN\nIt's getting late, I think it's\ntime I showed you to your new room.\nWill yawns and rubs his eyes sleepily.\nWILL\nOkay.\nThey leave the chamber of the crystal ball, passing again\nthrough the dining room, and John takes Will up a winding set\nof stairs to the top of the building. He shows him into his\nroom, which is by no means extravagant, but certainly very\ncomfortable. In fact, it looks exactly the same as the room\nthat Roger awoke from in his dream.\nJOHN\nI trust you'll be comfortable in\nhere?\nWILL\nYes...\nJOHN\nGood. Get some sleep, and I'll see\nyou in the morning. We have a big\nday ahead of us.\nWill walks over to his bed and starts taking off his shoes.\nJohn closes the door and heads back downstairs.\nEXT. THE TRAINCAR PLATFORM - DAY\nRoger and Percy are sitting on the platform. The sun has\nbegun to set, and it casts long shadows on the prairie as the\ntrain rolls along.\n49.\nROGER\nAll right. So what do we have to do\nnext?\nPERCY\nWhat we have to do next, is go\nthrough that door and speak to an\nold acquaintance of mine. Please be\ncareful, all right? We're almost\nthere.\nROGER\nI'll be careful, I promise.\nThey both get up, and move towards the door. Roger opens it,\nand they step through. Like the ones before, it bangs shut\nbehind them, seemingly on its own.\nEXT. A WIDE OPEN PLAIN - NIGHT\nThe two riders tear across the prairie at full gallop, their\nhorses panting with exertion. The plain rumbles beneath them\nas their hooves beat the earth. Suddenly, from above, Xerxes\nswoops down and glides between them, screeching loudly to\nalert them of his presence. Luther turns back just in time,\nand he sticks out his arm for the bird to land upon. It does,\nand the two Rangers bring their horses to an abrupt halt.\nLUTHER\nWhat brings you here, friend?\nMARTIN\nUnwrap his leg.\nLuther looks closer and sees that a note is indeed wrapped\naround Xerxes' leg. He gently takes it off and unfurls it.\nLUTHER\nI can't read it, come here and give\nme a light.\nMartin guides his horse over and lights a match, by which\nthey are able to make out what John has written.\nLUTHER (CONT'D)\n(reading the note)\nTrying to get to Mother\nFlorence's...must not make\ncontact...\nThey read a moment longer.\n50.\nMARTIN\nSeems pretty straight-forward to\nme.\nLuther pockets the note and looks up at Martin.\nLUTHER\nWell, look, we know what John wants\ndone, he doesn't care how we do it.\nI say we head straight for Flo's.\nMARTIN\nFine by me.\nThey whip the horses into motion and gallop off on a slightly\naltered course. Xerxes takes off back in the direction of\nJohn's house.\nINT. A DIMLY LIT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nPercy and Roger stand in front of the door inside a large,\nwell-furnished living room. Bookshelves line the walls,\nfilled to the ceiling with volumes, and a large fire roars in\nthe fireplace. A ornately-carved rotating wooden armchair\nstands in the middle of the room with its back to the\ntravelers. A puff of pipe smoke floats into the air, and the\nchair swivels about to reveal a very old man, NICK. He is\nextremely small and fragile looking, and the chair seems to\nall but swallow him up whole. He wears bifocals and a\nweathered tweed jacket, and he considers Roger and Percy\ncarefully while smoking a long-stemmed pipe.\nPERCY\nHello, Nick.\nNICK\nWhy, hello, Percy!\nHis voices wheezes with mustiness, and the weight of his\nyears seems to be present in each word.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nAnd what sort of guest did you\nbring with you this evening?\nPERCY\nThis is my friend, Roger. We're\nboth in a bit of a predicament you\nsee...it's a long story, I won't\nbore you, but ah.. Well, we simply\nmust see the conductor...please?\n51.\nThere is a note of desperation in Percy's voice.\nNICK\nRoger, come over here for a moment.\nMy eyes aren't so good, let me have\na look at you.\nRoger does as he is asked, and Nick looks him over with\nbeady, staring eyes.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nHave you ever played checkers,\nRoger?\nROGER\nSure, all the time. My brother and\nI play..used to play all the time.\nNICK\nGood, that's good. If there is one\nthing I love, it's a good game of\ncheckers against a worthy opponent.\nWould you like to play a game?\nRoger looks over at Percy, unsure.\nROGER\nI guess so...but Percy isn't lying,\nwe really need to see the\nconductor.\nNick laughs, but it ends in sharp coughing.\nNICK\nYou're a well-spoken boy, Roger. I\nknow he isn't lying. I tell you\nwhat...\nNick reaches down beside his chair and pulls out a\ncheckerboard, along with a small bag of checkers. He places\nthem on an end table, and motions for Roger to sit on the\ndivan that is nearby. Roger moves it over next to the table\nand takes a seat, still looking very apprehensive.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nYou and I will play a game. Just\none game. If you win, I'll let you\nand Percy go through, but if you\nlose, it's back the way you came.\nRoger gulps and looks at Percy again. Percy shrugs his\nshoulders, adding a look that says 'we have no choice.'\n52.\nROGER\nOkay. I'll play. But you have to\npromise to let us through if I win.\nNICK\nI promise. But there's a catch. For\nevery piece you jump, I will ask\nyou something. A riddle. Answer it\nincorrectly, and you lose your\npiece instead. But get it right,\nand you take an extra one of mine.\nROGER\n(indignant)\nWhat about when you jump one of my\npieces?\nNick laughs.\nNICK\nWell, then, you've just lost a\npiece!\nPERCY\nIf I may interject, Nick, that\nhardly seems fair!\nNick answers coolly, but his tone rises slightly in anger.\nNICK\nNow, Percy, it hardly seems\nappropriate for you to dictate the\nrules of MY favorite game, to ME,\nin MY living room. Does it?\nPERCY\nNo..\nNICK\nI'm glad we agree. Then let us play\non, my boy. Unless of course, you'd\nrather go back...\nPERCY\nNo! Absolutely not. He'll play.\nRight, Roger?\nRoger nods, and dutifully turns towards the board, where Nick\nis already setting up the pieces. They are beautiful: small\nornate discs carved by hand out of ivory and ebony. They snap\nsharply against the wooden board as Nick expertly lays them\ndown.\n53.\nNICK\nAll right, Roger, you go first.\nRoger makes his move, and Nick makes his almost immediately\nafter, without any hesitation at all. Roger considers the\nboard carefully, then slowly makes his second move. Nick\ncomes back with another instantaneous placement. Roger does\nnot seem intimidated. Percy does, however, and he paces about\nthe room nervously. Roger loses a couple of pieces, but then\nhe makes a clever double jump to threaten two of Nick's\ncheckers.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nWell, well, that's a good move!\nNow, I believe that's two riddles I\nowe you..\nROGER\nNow hold on a minute! That's not\nright. If I had jumped two pieces\non different turns, sure, you would\nask me two riddles. But I doublejumped. That means you ask me one,\nand if I get it right, I've\ncaptured two more.\nNick looks a little astonished at this display of boldness.\nNICK\nAh..hm.. I like your tenacity,\nRoger. You're my kind of player!\nOne question for four of my pieces\nthen, eh? Naturally I'll have to\nthink of something\nrather...perplexing. Don't forget,\nI'm asking you alone, Roger. No\nhelp from your fine-feathered\nfriend over there.\nNick pauses and puffs his pipe, thinking carefully about\nwhich riddle to select. After a moment, he looks up. He's got\nit.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nThe life I lead is all too short;\nand all the while I am consumed.\nI'm fast when thin, and slow when\nfat, and my only enemy is the wind.\nWhat am I?\nRoger's face goes blank.\n54.\nROGER\nI...I don't know.\nPercy looks terrified.\nPERCY\nCome on, Roger, think!\nNICK\nQuiet, Percy.\nRoger gets over his initial befuddlement and frowns, thinking\nhard.\nROGER\n(to himself)\nConsumed all my life...only enemy\nis the wind. Something that burns!\nSo...fast when thin, slow when\nfat...a life all too short...\nHe looks up at Nick and smiles.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nI've got it! You're a candle.\nNICK\n(taken aback)\nAh..Well done my boy! But of course\nthat was an exceedingly easy one.\nNext time it won't be so...selfexplanatory.\nRoger looks back at Percy with a smile. He collects his two\njumped pieces, and then moves to select two more from Nick's\nside.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nNow, now, just a moment. I think\nI'll pick those extra two.\nHe strategically takes two of his pieces, which create\nperfect open lanes to capture Roger's men.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nThere you go!\nHe hands the pieces to Roger, who accepts them with a\ngrimace.\nPERCY\nWell that's helpful.\n55.\nROGER\nDon't worry, Percy, I'm really good\nat this game. You'll see.\nNICK\n(mockingly)\nYes, you'll see. My turn, I\nbelieve?\nNick quickly makes a double jump on Roger, on two pieces that\nwere poised to attack him. Roger groans.\nNICK (CONT'D)\n(smugly)\nYour move.\nRoger carefully considers the board. He sees his move, and\njumps one of Nick's pieces.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nWell, another good move, my young\nfriend. But you know the rules. Now\nlet's see...\nRoger looks back at Percy, unsure that he will be able to\nsolve the next riddle.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nMhmm, mhmm. Okay, I've got it. This\none should stump you.\nHe pauses for a moment, remembering how it goes.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nThe poor have me; the rich need me.\nI am greater than John Barleycorn,\nand more evil than the Famine. If\nyou eat me, you will die. What am\nI?\nROGER\nMore evil than the Famine?\nNICK\nOf course, the Famine. She's the\nmost evil force ever to appear in\nthis land.\nROGER\nYou must be...nothing.\nNick curses under his breath.\n56.\nNICK\nI don't believe it. Confound it\nall, that was my best riddle!\nHe picks up the captured checker and an extra one from the\nother side. In his frustration, he does not realize that he\nhas exposed himself to the perfect triple jump. Roger's eyes\nlight up, but Nick does not notice.\nNICK (CONT'D)\n(crossly)\nWell, never mind. It's my turn.\nHe makes a rather hasty move, only taking one of Roger's\npieces, but setting himself on the back row to be kinged.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nYou know what to do, eh?\nRoger nods and takes one of Nick's captured men and places it\non top.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nIn trouble now, I think. Go ahead.\nRoger picks up his piece and jumps three of Nick's remaining\nsix pieces, slowly and deliberately. Nick gasps.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nWhat?! Oh no...\nPERCY\nHa! I suggest you think of a good\none Nick. If he gets this one\nright, you're finished!\nNick knits his brow, ignoring Percy.\nNICK\n(to himself)\nHm...must come up with a good one.\nOne he's sure not to know.\nNo...no...no...something different.\nYes! I've got it.\nNick looks up with a sinister grin.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nYou'll never get this one. But\nfirst...\nHe produces an ordinary-looking brass key, and lays it down\non the table next to the checkerboard.\n57.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nYou probably want to see what\nyou're playing for. This key will\ntake you through the door behind\nme, and then you're home free.\nPercy has hopped up onto the mantle of the fireplace, a few\nfeet above the players' heads. He looks down at their table,\neyeing the key eagerly. Nick notices the look.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nDon't get any of your clever ideas,\nPercy! This key won't work unless I\ntell it to. Now then, are you\nready, Roger?\nHe nods his head.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nThen here it is. I am large as a\nmountain, but I look small as a\npea. I float on forever in a\nwaterless sea. What am I?\nEXT. THE ROOF OF WILL AND ROGER'S TREEHOUSE - NIGHT -\nFLASHBACK\nRoger and Will lie on the roof of their treehouse, looking up\nat the glittering sky above.\nROGER\nWill, look, a shooting star!\nHe traces its path across the sky with one finger while Will\nlooks on in fascination.\nWILL\nWow...that's amazing. How do stars\nstay up in the sky, Roger?\nROGER\nI don't know...I guess they just\nfloat there.\nWILL\n(laughing)\nLike beach balls in the ocean!\nROGER\nYeah, I guess so. But there isn't\nany water in space, Will.\n58.\nWILL\nYeah, I know. How big do you think\nthey really are?\nROGER\nHow big do I think what really are?\nWILL\nThe stars, Roger!\nROGER\nOh. Hm. Well, imagine somebody\nreached down and ripped Mount\nKatahdin off the face of Maine, and\ntossed it into space.\nWILL\nIt'd get burnt up in the\natmosphere.\nROGER\nNo, no, it just gets tossed into\nspace. Like a beach ball in the\nocean, right?\nWILL\nYeah...\nROGER\nThat's how big stars are.\nWILL\nWow! Really?\nROGER\nYep. They're big as mountains, they\njust look tiny from here.\nINT. NICK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY\nRoger looks up with a triumphant smile on his face. Nick is\nconfused.\nNICK\nWhat, what is it? What am I?\nROGER\nThat's easy, you're a star.\nNICK\nWhat?! That's impossible! How did\nyou know?\n59.\nROGER\nI just remembered something that my\nbrother said once.\nNICK\nThis is ridiculous. Forget it, you\ncheated!\nAs the words leave his lips, Percy jumps down from his perch\nand scoops the key up in his beak, right before Nick can grab\nit.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nHey, that's mine!\nPERCY\nYou promised us we would get\nthrough if he beat you. It was fair\nand square!\nNICK\nI'll show you fair and square!\nHe makes a move to stand up, but he suddenly erupts into a\ncoughing fit, and immediately sits back down. After a moment,\nhe breathes easy again, though he seems greatly subdued.\nNICK (CONT'D)\nI'm...sorry. I shouldn't have\naccused you of cheating. You're a\nworthy opponent Roger, quite\ncunning.\nPERCY\nTell the key to work, Nick. Please.\nNICK\n'This key shall turn that lock'.\nThere, that's all it is. It will\nwork now. Go on, I must rest.\nRoger takes the key from Percy, and the bolt turns smoothly\nas he unlocks the door.\nEXT. THE TRAINCAR PLATFORM - NIGHT\nPercy and Roger emerge into the night air on the final\nplatform before the main car.\nPERCY\nRoger, that was amazing! How did\nyou solve those riddles?\n60.\nROGER\nI don't know, they just came to me.\nPERCY\nWell, you've saved our shot at\nseeing the conductor yet again. I\nthank you from the bottom of my\nheart, Roger. You are a true\ncompanion!\nROGER\nThanks, Percy. Don't mention it.\nPERCY\nAll right, we're almost there. I\nmust tell you, it's very important\nthat we're polite to the conductor.\nOtherwise, he might not help us. Do\nyou understand?\nROGER\nYes.\nPERCY\nGood. Then let's go.\nThey open the door and step inside.\nINT. THE CONDUCTOR'S CAB\nA dimly lit figure stands at the front of the train, his\nhands on the controls and his eyes on the tracks ahead. It is\nTHE CONDUCTOR, and he wears a blue visored railway hat, along\nwith blue overalls. He does not appear to notice the entrance\nof Roger and Percy. The pair walks closer.\nCONDUCTOR\nHold it. Names.\nThey stop.\nPERCY\n(clearing his throat)\nAh, it's Percy, sir, and this is my\nfriend Roger.\nCONDUCTOR\nRoger, eh? You handled Nick pretty\nwell back there.\nROGER\nUm.. Thank you. How did you know?\n61.\nCONDUCTOR\nOh, I know pretty much everything\nthat goes on this in this train.\nGotta keep an eye on things, you\nknow.\nROGER\nYes..of course.\nCONDUCTOR\nNaturally, I know where you fellas\nwant to go. I can drop you off at\nthe next station, and it's maybe a\nhalf hour walk from there. We\nshould we arriving shortly.\nPercy and Roger exchange looks of relief.\nEXT. THE TRAIN\nThe black cab of the locomotive lumbers along into the night.\nEXT. THE TRAIN STATION - LATER\nRolling gently along, the train arrives at the station and\nmakes a full stop alongside a platform. Roger and Percy\nemerge from the door in the cab, looking around. The building\nattached to the platform is quite decrepit and seems to be\nabandoned, and lights from the train cause eerie shadows to\nleap around the broken shards of windowpane. They look back\nat the conductor still in the cab, and he waves goodbye to\nthem. The train begins to start up, and soon rolls away from\nthe station.\nThe travelers depart from the platform and begin their\njourney, headed away from the train.\nPERCY\nCome on, I know the way. It's not\nfar from here.\nThey hike along into the distance, with wind blowing clouds\nof dust across the sweeping plain.\nEXT. THE OPEN PLAINS - NIGHT\nMartin and Luther trot along on their steeds, approaching\nwhat appears to be a campfire a little ways in the distance.\n62.\nMARTIN\nAll right. So are we clear on the\nplan?\nLUTHER\nAbsolutely.\nEXT. A SMALL CAMPSITE - NIGHT\nA campfire roars in the center of three tents, pitched around\nin a circle, their entrances facing in. Seated on a small\nwooden chair is MOTHER FLORENCE, a middle-aged, dark skinned\nwoman wearing a handkerchief on her head and a dusty cotton\ndress. She looks pensively at the fire. A small boy emerges\nfrom the tent by her side. It is her son CALVIN, 6 years old.\nCALVIN\nMama, why are you still awake?\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOh, I can't sleep, honey, that's\nall.\nCALVIN\nWhy not? What's wrong?\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nI just have a bad feeling.\nSomething isn't right.\nCALVIN\nI don't know, mama, everything\nseems all right.\nShe smiles and strokes his hair affectionately.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nYou're probably right child.\nNothing to worry about.\nCALVIN\nI'm gonna go back to sleep, I'm\ntired again.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOkay. Sweet dreams, dear.\nCALVIN\nGood night, mama.\nHe retreats back into his tent, laying down on a soft spread\nof furs.\n63.\nHe rests his head on the pillow and quickly falls asleep\nagain. Mother Florence does not bother sleeping, despite her\nson's attempt to soothe her. She stares at the fire a moment\nlonger.\nSuddenly, she pricks up her ears. Faintly, in the distance,\nshe can hear the sound of hoof beats. The riders are\ngalloping full-tilt towards Mother Florence's campsite.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. MOTHER FLORENCE'S CAMPSITE\nShe stands up in terror, and looks out into the night trying\nto make out the horses.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAMPSITE\nMartin and Luther close in, firing their guns in the air as\nthey bear down on the tents.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. CAMPSITE\nMother Florence now sees the white horses and their riders\nemerge out of the darkness. She screams in terror, and\nhurries to wake her children up. Calvin and his little sister\nMAISY are clearly distressed at having been disturbed from\ntheir slumber.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nWake up, wake up, wake up! We have\nto go, now!!\nThe children drowsily raise themselves out of bed, but\nsuddenly gunshots go off extremely close to their tents. Fear\nshakes them fully awake, and they immediately begin to cry,\nreaching out for their mother. They leave the tent to hear\nthe thunderous sound of hooves bearing down on them, fast.\nMother Florence turns to run away from the campsite with her\nchildren, but from out of the darkness come the two Rangers,\nlike white angels of death. The massive horses easily trample\nthe tents and campfire, flaring their nostrils with\nexhilaration. Martin and Luther look about, and easily spot\nMother Florence and the children trying to escape into the\nnight.\n64.\nLUTHER\nThere!\nThey rally the horses and gallop towards the trio. Each\nranger reaches out with brawny arms, and plucks up a member\nof the group, right off the ground. Martin snatches Calvin,\nand Luther picks up Mother Florence herself. Maisy stands\nalone on the prairie, crying hysterically.\nMAISY\nMama, come back, come back!\nInstead of her Mother, however, it is Martin coming back. He\nhas Calvin gripped under one arm, kicking and struggling, and\nwhile still controlling the horse and the boy he manages to\nscoop up Maisy as well. He spins his horse back around and\nrides off into the darkness to follow Luther back to John's.\nINT. JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\nJohn leaves Will's room, shutting the door gently behind him.\nHe walks down the long hallway, down the stairs, and enters\nthe dining hall.\nINT. THE DINING HALL\nMandrake stands at attention by the far wall. He stares at\nthe fire, still roaring by the table. John takes a seat at\nthe table.\nJOHN\nHe's asleep. Shouldn't be too long\nnow.\nMANDRAKE\nYes sir. One hour left until\nmidnight.\nJOHN\nHe'll learn to like it here,\nMandrake.\nMANDRAKE\nAfter the portal closes forever,\nhe'll have to, sir.\nJOHN\nRight as usual. Only, his brother\nand Percy are still out there,\nwandering around.\n65.\nMANDRAKE\nWith Mother Florence in our care,\nsir, they may very well end up lost\non the plains forever.\nJOHN\nYou're right again, Mandrake. Well,\nlet them wander. I already have one\nboy who can be a good son. If Percy\nand Roger are lost forever, it's of\nno particular concern to me. Kill\ntwo birds with one stone, I say.\nMANDRAKE\nI believe you mean one bird and one\nboy, sir.\nThey share an evil laugh.\nINT. THE DOOR TO THE DINING HALL\nWill stands in the hallway with his ear pressed to the door.\nUnderstandably, he was having some trouble getting to sleep.\nRealizing that their conversation is about him, he turns to\nrun down the hallway. His eyes dart about like a frightened\nanimal, and he runs for the door at the other end of the\nhall. He finds himself in the kitchen. He sees the exit at\nthe other end of the hall and sprints for it, then opens the\nscreen door and dashes down the porch steps. His flight is\nbrought to an abrupt halt, however, as he runs straight into\nthe outstretched arms of Luther, who is standing guard with\nMartin. Will screams in terror and struggles to get free, but\nLuther handles him easily.\nLUTHER\nWhoa! Where do you think you're\ngoin', cowboy?\nWILL\nPut me down!!\nMARTIN\nThese kids...why you think they're\nalways tryin' to run away, Luther?\nLUTHER\nI don't know, but I can make damn\nsure it doesn't happen again.\n66.\nThey walk inside the house, striding purposefully towards the\ndining room with Will still kicking and struggling under\nLuther's arm. They burst the door open and walk in to very\nsurprised looks from John and Mandrake.\nJOHN\nWhat...what's going on?\nLUTHER\nYour boy, boss, he was tryin' to\nget away.\nJOHN\nIs that so?\nMARTIN\nYes sir, Luther nabbed him just as\nhe was jumping off your porch.\nLooked like he was runnin' from the\nDevil himself.\nWILL\nPut me down, NOW!\nJOHN\nOh you'll be put down, my young\nfriend, in your original quarters.\nI thought you were a good boy,\nWill, I guess I was wrong. Luther?\nTake him down to the cells, please.\nLUTHER\nYou got it, boss.\nThe Rangers turn to go, taking Will with them.\nMANDRAKE\nHe'll get used to it, sir.\nJOHN\nOh I know, it takes time just like\nanything else. I have very high\nhopes for this one.\nINT. THE DUNGEON - NIGHT\nThe Rangers emerge from the heavy metal door to the dungeon\nand walk down the few steps to the main row of cells. Luther\nstill carries Will, but he has stopped struggling and merely\nweeps quietly. Martin takes a ring of keys from a hook on the\nwall, and opens the cell down the hall on the left.\n67.\nLuther sets him down inside the cell on his cot. Will\nimmediately turns over on his side, and stares at the wall.\nMartin and Luther exit, and Martin locks the door shut, then\nreturns the ring of keys to its hook. They leave, clanging\nthe hall door behind them.\nMOTHER FLORENCE (O.S.)\nHey! Hey over there!\nWill gets up and looks across to the opposite cell. Inside\nare Mother Florence and her children, who lie sleeping on\ntheir cots.\nWILL\nWho are you?\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nMy name is Mother Florence, child,\nwhat's your name?\nWILL\nI'm Will.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nAre you the little boy that was\ncoming to see me, with Percy?\nWILL\nHuh? No. Who's Percy?\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOh you know, Percy, the talking\ncrow, he was coming with you!\nWILL\nNo, I never met any talking crows.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nHmm..Wait a minute, it was your\nbrother! You've got a brother,\nhaven't you, Will?\nWILL\nYeah! My older brother, Roger. He's\ncoming to get us, I saw him!\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOf course, of course, it all makes\nsense now. Except, how did you see\nhim?\n68.\nWILL\nJohn Barleycorn showed me, with his\ncrystal ball. They were on the\ntrain and I saw them go inside one\nof the cars.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nThat's right, they're on the train.\nThey were coming to see me, for\nhelp in getting you back, child.\nWILL\nI knew it! But, how do you know\nabout them?\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOh, the conductor told me a couple\ndays ago, said he's expecting to\ndrop off some passengers by my\nstation and to keep my eyes out.\nWILL\nOh..\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nWell, it's all right, I'm sure\nyou're brother is on his way right\nnow. Don't worry a bit.\nWILL\nYeah, I think you're right. I hope\nhe gets here soon!\nINT. THE DINING HALL\nJohn sits at the head of the table, with Mandrake, Martin,\nand Luther seated around him.\nJOHN\nNow look, gentlemen, we all know\nthe portal closes for good at\nmidnight. We've lost one boy on the\nplains, and the other one almost\ngot away once tonight. I do not\nwant it to happen again. There has\nbeen too much laziness, and\nstupidity, and inactivity around\nhere lately, and frankly, I'm\ngetting very tired of it.\nThe three men exchange looks of confusion.\n69.\nMARTIN\nBoss...we haven't done anything\nwrong.\nJOHN\nI don't care! The boy must not\nescape. Do you think you can handle\nthat?\nMARTIN\nYes, boss.\nLUTHER\nYes, boss.\nMANDRAKE\nYes, sir.\nJOHN\nJust make sure things go smoothly,\nfor once.\nMARTIN\nThe boy is locked up tight, along\nwith Mother Florence and her kids.\nThey're not going anywhere, boss.\nJOHN\nGood. Well, all that's left to do\nis wait.\nMANDRAKE\nHalf an hour until midnight, sir.\nEXT. MOTHER FLORENCE'S CAMPSITE - NIGHT\nRoger and Percy arrive at the campsite to find it completely\nransacked. The tents have been crushed, and the campfire is a\nsmoldering mess. Broken tent poles stick out of the ground\nlike broken bones. A lonely trail of smoke curls through the\nair.\nROGER\n(shocked)\nWhat happened?\nPERCY\nOh no, no, no, this is terrible!\nHow can this be?\nThey quickly look through the wreckage of the campsite, and\ndetermine that no one is there.\n70.\nROGER\nThey're gone, Percy. Somebody took\nthem.\nPERCY\nI know who.\nROGER\nYou do?\nPERCY\nWho else could have done this? It\nhas to be the work of those two\nogres, Martin and Luther.\nROGER\nWho are they?\nPERCY\nMen who work for John Barleycorn.\nHe likes to call them his Rangers.\nROGER\nOh..what do we do?\nPERCY\nWe have to go there. To John's.\nROGER\nBut how? Do you know the way?\nPERCY\nNo, but I know how to get there.\nPercy makes a wide gesture at the ground. Roger looks down\nand sees a flurry of hoof prints in the dust, which make a\nfew loops and then form two sets running off into the\ndarkness. Roger looks up at Percy in understanding.\nROGER\nLet's go!\nPERCY\nLead the way, my friend.\nThe duo runs off to follow the hoof prints.\nEXT. JOHN'S FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER\nRoger and Percy pull up in front of the house, gasping for\nbreath. They look up at the house, which looms ominously\nbefore them, shrouded in shadows.\n71.\nBeyond the house, a gloomy-looking forest rises up into the\nsky like black, skeletal fingers.\nPERCY\nThis is it. From here on, things\ncould get dangerous. We must be\nextremely careful.\nThe house appears dark and silent. No activity is detectable\nfrom outside.\nROGER\nOnce we get inside, let's split up\nto find Will.\nPERCY\nHow will you get around?\nROGER\nSomething tells me I've been here\nbefore. I'll be all right.\nPERCY\nOkay. Let's go.\nThey proceed into the house.\nINT. JOHN'S HOUSE\nPercy and Roger cautiously open the screen door and step\ninside. They listen carefully, but hear nothing. Candles\nflicker in holders on the wall, dimly lighting the interior.\nPERCY\n(whispering)\nI'll go this way. You check in the\nbasement.\nRoger gives him the thumbs up. Percy proceeds down the\nhallway, treading ever so softly. Roger heads for the door to\nthe basement, and begins his descent down the steps.\nINT. THE DUNGEON\nWill and Mother Florence sit in their separate cells. Maisy\nand Calvin have woken up, and they sit on the floor passing a\nball back and forth. They look over and see Will, alone,\nhanging his head.\nCALVIN\nHey, you want to play?\n72.\nWill looks up eagerly.\nWILL\nYeah!\nCALVIN\nOkay. I'll pass you the ball, and\nyou have to bounce it back through\nthe bars. Think you can do it?\nWILL\nYes, I think so.\nCALVIN\nGood! Every time you get it back\nthrough, it's ten points.\nWill gets up and stands ready by the bars. Calvin bounces it\nacross, straight into Will's outstretched hands. Aiming\ncarefully, he sends it back across the corridor, through the\nbars to Calvin.\nCALVIN (CONT'D)\nGood one! Now it's my turn.\nWill steps back, and Calvin lobs the ball to him.\nWILL\nTen points!\nMAISY\nI want to try!\nCALVIN\nAll right, catch this one and then\nthrow it back.\nMAISY\nOkay.\nWill tosses the ball, and Maisy catches it.\nMAISY (CONT'D)\nI did it!\nCALVIN\nGood going, Maisy. Now toss it\nback!\nShe lines the ball up with the bars on Will's cell, preparing\nto throw.\n73.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nI don't know about this game,\nchildren, you're going to lose that\nball. Then what will you play with?\nCALVIN\nWe won't lose it, mama.\nMaisy chucks the ball, but it bounces off one of the bars and\nrolls down the hallway. It stops against the steps at the end\nof the hall.\nMAISY\nOh no...\nCALVIN\nMaisy! Why did you do that?!\nMAISY\nI'm sorry, Calvin, I missed!\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nChildren, don't fight!\nSuddenly the metal door above the steps begin to creak open.\nCALVIN\nNow look what you've done! We've\nhad it, Maisy.\nShe starts to cry. The door opens all the way to reveal a\ntriumphant Roger.\nWILL\nRoger!!\nHe dashes down the corridor to Will, who is overjoyed to see\nhim. They embrace through the bars.\nROGER\nWill! How did you get here?\nWILL\nThat man upstairs, John Barleycorn,\nhe put me here. I think he wants us\nto stay here forever. This poor\nlady told me John wrecked her home,\ntoo.\nRoger turns around to see Mother Florence and the children in\ntheir cell.\n74.\nROGER\nAre you...Mother Florence?\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nYes I am. You must be Roger. It's a\npleasure to finally meet you.\nROGER\nPercy and I...we saw your camp. I'm\nso sorry.\nMother Florence waves her hand dismissively.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOh, that. What's important is that\nwe're all safe and sound, for now.\nI think we really should get going,\nthough.\nROGER\nAll right, I'm getting you all out\nof here.\nWILL\nQuick, the keys are on that hook\nover there!\nRoger dashes over and grabs the keys. He quickly finds the\none for Will's cell, and lets his brother out first. Then he\nopens the door for Mother Florence, and they all move down\nthe hallway and out the door.\nWILL (CONT'D)\nRoger, who's Percy?\nROGER\nHuh?\nWILL\nYou said, 'Percy and I saw your\ncamp' when you were talking to\nMother Florence. Who is he?\nROGER\nOh...he's a talking crow I met on\nthe train.\nWILL\nA talking crow?! What...well, where\nis he now?\n75.\nROGER\nWe split up to look for you. He\nshould be upstairs, we'll find him\nand then get out of here.\nThey open the door at the top of the stairs and emerge into\nthe entrance hall of the house.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nHe should be around here\nsomewhere...\nPERCY (O.C.)\nHelp! Somebody help me!\nThey suddenly hear Percy's distress call, coming from\nsomewhere inside the house. Roger's face turns white.\nROGER\nThat's him! I have to go save him.\nWILL\nI'm not leaving you again, Roger.\nRoger appears conflicted, but puts his hand on Will's\nshoulder to acknowledge the gesture of loyalty.\nROGER\nOkay.. Mother Florence, you should\ntake your children and get out of\nhere. This might be dangerous.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nAll right, child. We'll try to find\nsome way to help. Good luck to you\nboth!\nCALVIN\nBye, Will!\nWILL\nBye!\nMother Florence, Maisy, and Calvin all silently leave through\nthe screen door. She hurries them along once they get\noutside. Roger and Will bravely continue on towards the sound\nof Percy's cries for help. They turn the corner to go down\nanother hallway, and find a door that seems to be very close\nto the sounds of distress.\n76.\nWILL (CONT'D)\nThis is the dining room. I don't\nthink we should go in there, Roger,\nwe can just leave right now.\nROGER\nWe can't just leave, Will, Percy's\nin there! I would never have gotten\nthis far if it weren't for him, we\nhave to try and save him.\nWILL\nBut Roger, I'm really scared! I\nthink he wants us to stay here\nforever, I don't want that, I want\nto play in our treehouse, I want to\nsee dad again!\nWill begins to cry, and he sits down against the wall in\ndefeat. Roger sits down next to him and puts an arm around\nhis shoulder.\nROGER\nCome on Will, don't worry, we're\ngoing to be fine! Here, I've got\nsomething for you.\nRoger takes the Barlow knife out of his pocket and puts it in\nWill's hand.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nHere. Dad gave me this. It'll help\nyou be brave.\nWill picks his head up. He opens the knife and looks at it in\nthe dim candlelight of the hallway.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nNow, are you ready?\nWill stands up.\nWILL\nYes!\nROGER\nAll right. Now, on the count of\nthree. One..two..three!\nThey throw the door open and step into the main dining hall,\nto see Mandrake, Luther, Martin, and John, all standing\naround the fire place. They turn around, and the boys see\nthat Percy is being held tightly in John's hands.\n77.\nJOHN\nWell! If it isn't our favorite\nlittle Houdini impersonators!\nSomehow I am not surprised.\nROGER\nYou! I dreamed about you.\nJOHN\nThat's right, Roger. And now you're\nhere. I couldn't be more pleased.\nROGER\nPut down my friend.\nJOHN\nOh, I don't think so. Xerxes heard\nhim going upstairs and let me know\nthere was an intruder. And that's\njust what you are, Percy. An\nintruder.\nPERCY\nPut me down, John!\nJOHN\nI keep hearing that today.. Well,\nas you wish.\nJohn begins to lower Percy towards the roaring fire. He\nstruggles valiantly, but to no avail. John holds him firmly\nand moves him closer to the blaze.\nROGER\nNo!!\nRoger charges at John, but is intercepted by Luther, who\npicks him up with one hand and pins him to the wall.\nLUTHER\nI am sick of you little kids\nrunnin' around all over the place!\nWill bravely runs over and starts pounding on Luther's treetrunk sized leg. Luther gives him a swift kick, and Will\nfalls down in a daze against one of the benches at the table.\nPercy appears to be done for. Suddenly, the doors burst open.\nIn walk Daniel, Nathan, and Isaac. They are wielding very\nlarge scythes.\nNATHAN\nHello, John.\n78.\nJOHN\nNathan! What a pleasant surprise.\nHe stops himself from moving Percy any closer to the fire.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nIsaac, Daniel, nice to see you too.\nNow, what can I do for you\ngentlemen at this hour?\nNATHAN\nWe're getting these boys out of\nhere. They need to go home, John.\nJOHN\nWhy, here is home now, don't you\nsee?\nHe gestures towards Roger and Will.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nThese boys...they're going to love\nliving here.\nNATHAN\nI don't think so John. Now put down\nthe bird, he's coming with us too.\nJOHN\nNow, Nathan, don't make me laugh!\nNATHAN\nI'll ask you one last time. Put the\nbird down, John.\nJOHN\nEnough of this ridiculous chitchat. Martin, Luther, please take\ncare of these guests. I think\nthey've worn out their welcome.\nLuther lowers Roger to the ground, and the Rangers advance\nmenacingly upon the three men. Martin and Luther have a\ndistinct size advantage, and even though the men are armed\nwith scythes it seems like an unfair match.\nNATHAN\nWhoa, now hold on a minute! Those\nwouldn't be your horses out there\nright now, would they?\n79.\nMartin and Luther look out the window, just in time to see\ntheir white horses riding helter skelter out into the\ndarkness, away from the house.\nMARTIN\nWhat the...\nLUTHER\nPerseus!\nMARTIN\nWe gotta go, boss, I'm real sorry.\nThey dash out of the dining room and outside, chasing their\nhorses off into the night, running as fast as they can.\nLUTHER\n(fading away)\nPerseus, baby, wait!\nJohn looks at Mandrake expectantly.\nJOHN\nWell? Take care of them, Mandrake!\nMANDRAKE\nAh, sir, I don't think I can do\nthat.\nJOHN\nWhat do you mean? Throw them out!!\nMANDRAKE\nI...I'm sorry.\nWithout another word, Mandrake turns his back and walks out\nof the room. John turns back to Nathan with a look of fury.\nJOHN\nWell, this is just perfect.\nHe violently hurls Percy against the opposite wall, and he\ncrumples to the floor in a shower of feathers.\nROGER\nPercy!\nHe runs over to help him. The three men advance on John.\nJOHN\nSo it has come to this. Well, then,\non with it!\n80.\nIn a flash, John reaches for the saber that is mounted on the\nmantle. He whips it out of the scabbard and stands to\nconfront Nathan, Isaac, and Daniel. The three men charge.\nJohn's saber clashes against scythe, and a tremendous battle\nensues. John skillfully parries away each blow from the three\nmen, and despite being heavily outnumbered, John seems to be\ngaining the upper hand. He lashes out at Isaac, and manages\nto clip his arm, drawing blood. Shouting in pain, he drops\nhis scythe with a loud clatter and staggers back. Daniel and\nNathan are left to fight John. He forces them back, and\nNathan and Daniel are rapidly running out of space. They\ntrade blows back and forth with John, who is standing under a\nvery large, very heavy-looking wooden chandelier covered in\ncandles.\nNATHAN\nWill, do something!\nJOHN\nGive it up, Nathan, this doesn't\nconcern you!\nNATHAN\nYou're wrong John, these boys don't\nbelong here. They must be sent back\nthrough the portal!\nJOHN\nIt's almost midnight. Soon the\nportal will close forever, and\nWilliam shall be my heir.\nNATHAN\nHeir? I think you mean slave. I\ncan't allow that, John, you have no\nright! Just like you had no right\nto keep me and my brothers here,\nall those years ago.\nJOHN\nI'm sorry Nathan, it's far too late\nfor you to change anything.\nWill sees that the chandelier is connected to a thin rope on\nthe far wall, and he dashes over to where it is tied off. He\nstruggles for a moment with the knot, then remembers the\nknife in his pocket. He brings it out and begins to saw\nthrough the rope. Nathan charges.\nJOHN (CONT'D)\nThe boy...stays!!\n81.\nJohn locks his saber with Nathan's scythe, and with a\nmonumental amount of strength he hurls him back against the\nwall. Daniel stands back, alone, unsure what to do. John\nstands, breathing hard, preparing himself for the last\nattack. Suddenly, however, Will cuts through the rope, and\nthe chandelier comes plummeting down. John looks up, but too\nlate - the heavy wood crashes down on him, pinning him to the\nfloor. Daniel lowers his scythe, relieved. Nathan recovers\nhimself and gets up.\nNATHAN\nThank you.\nJohn struggles under the crushing weight of the chandelier.\nJOHN\n(gasping)\nHelp me...get this off me, please!\nNATHAN\nI don't think so, John. Not yet.\nIsaac, Daniel, you stay here and\nwatch him. Boys, come with me, we\nhave no time to lose!\nThe grandfather clock ticks steadily along, showing five\nminutes to midnight. Roger gathers Percy up, and he and Will\nleave the house with Nathan in the lead.\nEXT. JOHN'S FRONT PORCH - NIGHT\nThe three figures emerge out of the house, and are greeted by\nMother Florence and her children. Calvin and Maisy cling to\nher dress.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOh thank goodness! I heard such\nnoise in there, I was sure\nsomething terrible had happened.\nNATHAN\nEverything's all right now, ma'am,\nI just need to get these two home\nright away.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nYes, of course.\nWILL\nWe'll be okay, Mother Florence!\n82.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nI know you will, child. Have a safe\ntrip, now.\nROGER\nBut where will you stay?\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOh, we'll put things back together\nin the morning. No shame in\nsleeping out in the open air for a\nnight.\nNATHAN\nNonsense! There's a spare room in\nour farmhouse, you can stay with\nus.\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nOh! Why, that's very kind of you.\nThank you.\nNATHAN\nInside, talk to my brothers, Daniel\nand Isaac. They will help you. Ah,\nbut we really must be going.\nFarewell!\nMOTHER FLORENCE\nGoodbye!\nShe hurries inside with the children, and Nathan leads Roger\nand Will around to the back of the house. The forest looms\neerily just beyond.\nNATHAN\nCome on! We have to run.\nThey take off across the small clearing behind the house, and\nenter the forest. Nathan leads them to a very familiarlooking oak tree standing proudly in a clearing, away from\nthe other trees. The hole in the trunk shimmers with blue\nlight. They approach the tree.\nNATHAN (CONT'D)\nHere, just like the first time.\nYou'll be home again soon. Are you\nready?\nROGER\nYes...but why did you decide to\nhelp us?\n83.\nNATHAN\nWell...it's a long story, but I\ndidn't always live in this place.\nJohn brought me and my brothers\nhere too, like you boys. But it was\nthrough a different portal, and\nthat was a long time ago. We never\ngot a chance to go home. I couldn't\nlet it happen to you too, it just\nwasn't right. I'm sorry I let it\nget this far, it was my fault..\nROGER\nIt's all right. Thank you.\nNATHAN\nAh..you're welcome. But enough! You\nhave to go through now!\nWILL\nGoodbye!\nNATHAN\nGoodbye, children.\nWill climbs up through the portal first, and drops through to\nthe brilliant blue depths below. Roger goes right behind him\nwith Percy cradled in his arms, and they disappear from the\nland of John Barleycorn forever. Nathan watches a moment\nlonger, and the pool begins to waver and fade. Then, it\ncrackles out entirely. Nathan is left staring into the black\ndepths of an ordinary tree. He sighs and turns to go back to\nthe house.\nINT. JOHN'S DINING HALL - NIGHT\nNathan enters the room to find his brothers sitting on a\nbench by the table, looking utterly exhausted. John is still\nlying on the floor underneath the chandelier, unmoving. They\nlook up as Nathan enters.\nISAAC\nNathan, right after you left...\nNATHAN\nWhat, what happened?\nDANIEL\nJohn Barleycorn is dead.\n84.\nEXT. THE BOYS' GARDEN - DAY\nThe boys land on the ground at the edge of the garden, and\nthey look around, seeing the house and everything else\nexactly as they left it. The dew is still wet on the grass,\nand it appears to be early morning. The sun rises to the\neast, and they see their house up the hill past the garden,\njust as it always was.\nROGER\nWe did it, Will! We did it.\nThe boys joyfully embrace, and Roger momentarily forgets all\nabout Percy, bumping him roughly.\nPERCY\nHey! Be careful!\nROGER\nPercy, you're awake! Are you all\nright?\nPERCY\nYes, just a little banged up. No\nworse for the wear, though.\nROGER\nLet's go inside, we'll get you\nfixed up.\nThe boys hurry across the garden and up the hill to the house\nin the early morning sunshine.\nINT. THE HOUSE - DAY\nWill sits with Percy at the dining room counter, while Roger\nbustles about trying to find things that will help Percy. He\nfinds tape, popsicle sticks, and rubber bands, placing them\non the counter next to the injured bird. Percy, however, is\nable to stand up and move around on his own, surprisingly.\nROGER\nWait, don't get up yet! You'll hurt\nyourself.\nPERCY\nNo, I don't think I will, I feel\namazing!\nROGER\nWait...really?\n85.\nPERCY\nYes, I don't feel hurt at all. In\nfact...I feel something more than\nthat, too.\nPercy looks at Roger with a gleam in his eye.\nPERCY (CONT'D)\nRoger, let's go outside, quickly!\nROGER\nOkay, if you say so.\nRoger abandons his search for first aid, and all three\ncharacters rush outside with Percy in the lead.\nEXT. THE GARDEN EDGE - DAY\nThe sun is now up, and the boys stand by the side of the\ngarden, looking at Percy quizzically.\nROGER\nWell, what's the big fuss?\nPERCY\nMy wings...they feel light again.\nROGER\nWait, are you saying...?\nNot hesitating another moment, Percy leaps into the air and\nbeats his wings rapidly. Amazingly, he catches an updraft and\nmajestically soars upwards through the crisp morning air.\nRoger and Will cheer excitedly and race along past the garden\nas Percy swoops and dives, laughing with joy. He gets lower,\nso they are within conversational range.\nROGER (CONT'D)\nWhat happened? How can this be??\nPERCY\nI don't know, there is only one way\nfor this to happen and I can't\nimagine...\nROGER\nWhat, what's the only way for it to\nhappen?\nPercy swoops low and lands at their feet.\n86.\nPERCY\nWell, if he won't voluntarily give\nme my wings back...John Barleycorn\nmust die for it to happen. Then all\nthe spells he ever put on the\ninnocent people and creatures will\nvanish. But John Barleycorn can't\nbe dead, this doesn't make sense...\nROGER\nBut don't you remember? Will sent\nthat wooden thing crashing down on\nhis head. He must have died.\nWILL\nIt looked awful heavy...I don't\nthink he survived.\nPERCY\nTragic, I suppose. But you know he\nwanted to keep you boys there\nforever, right?\nWILL\nYes..\nPERCY\nI was unconscious that whole time.\nJohn really knocked me out by\nthrowing me against that wall.\nThat's the last thing I remember -\nthen I came to when your hugging\nbent my leg backwards!\nROGER\nOh yeah...sorry about that.\nPERCY\nWell thank goodness you made it\nback through. How did you know the\nportal was behind John's house?\nWILL\nWe didn't...Nathan, the man with\nthe scythe..\nROGER\nHe showed us how to get home.\nPERCY\nAh yes, I do seem to remember them\nshowing up as our unlikely\nrescuers.\n87.\nWILL\nBut Percy, now the portal's gone\nforever, how will you ever get\nhome?\nPERCY\n(laughing)\nOh don't worry, my only home was on\nthat train, and I think I was\ngetting pretty tired of it, anyway.\nI could get used to it here. It's\nquite a bit greener, isn't it?\nWILL\nYeah.\nPERCY\nWell boys, it's been a magnificent\nadventure. I have some flying to do\nthough, it's been a long time.\nROGER\nCome back and visit us! We'll meet\nin the treehouse, just over there.\nPERCY\nBy all means, my young friend.\nUntil then - farewell!\nTurning around, the crow flaps his wings and takes off into\nthe air, sailing on a perfect gust of wind. He cruises higher\nand higher, gaining altitude until the boys can just barely\nsee him. They turn to head back inside.\nWILL\nRoger, won't dad be upset that we\nwere gone for so long?\nROGER\nI don't know. Maybe...\nINT. THE KITCHEN\nThe boys go inside, and Roger busies himself with putting\naway the things he had taken out for Percy. Will goes over to\nlook at the tear-away calendar sitting on the counter. It\nshows Sunday, June 15th - the same day they left.\nWILL\nRoger, look! The calendar is the\nsame.\n88.\nROGER\nHow can that be?\nWILL\nI'm not sure.\nROGER\nCome on, let's go check on dad.\nThey dash upstairs, and peek their heads into dad's bedroom.\nHe is just getting up, rising sleepily from the covers.\nDAD\nBoys! Hi. You're up kind of early,\naren't you?\nROGER\nUm..yeah! We wanted to see if you\nwould make us breakfast.\nDAD\nSure, sure. Just give me a minute.\nThe boys go back downstairs.\nWILL\nHe didn't know we were missing at\nall, Roger.\nROGER\nI know...it's strange. I guess\nsomehow time stopped while we were\nboth on the other side.\nWILL\nTime...stopped?\nDad comes down into the kitchen, wearing his bathrobe.\nDAD\nAll right, what are we making,\npancakes, waffles, eggs?\nROGER\nDad, what day is it?\nDAD\nWhat day is it? It's Monday morning\nRoger, did you forget or something?\nROGER\nNo, just wanted to check.\n89.\nDAD\nAll right. Let's see, I feel like\nwaffles today.\nThe boys nod their heads in agreement. They go to sit down at\nthe counter.\nROGER\nSounds good, dad.\nDad bustles around the kitchen, getting out the waffle maker\nand ingredients.\nDAD\nSo, what are you guys planning for\ntoday. More work on the treehouse?\nThey do not respond. He looks up from mixing the batter to\nsee that they have both fallen asleep at the counter, using\ntheir arms as pillows.\nDAD (CONT'D)\nHm. I guess you guys were up a\nlittle too early, huh.\nHe comes over and picks up Will in one arm, who rests his\nhead comfortably against dad's shoulder. He nudges Roger\nawake, who flutters his eyes sleepily.\nDAD (CONT'D)\nCome on, let's go back to bed, you\ncan sleep a little longer.\nROGER\n(yawning)\nOkay.\nDAD\nWhy are you guys so exhausted,\nanyway?\nROGER\nOh we just..stayed up\nlate...reading.\nDAD\nHuh.\nCarrying Will and leading Roger by the hand, dad takes the\ntwo boys back up to their bedroom. He tucks Will in while\nRoger gets under his covers and snuggles up to the pillow.\n90.\nDAD (CONT'D)\nAll right, sleep as long as you\nwant, we'll make the waffles when\nyou get up.\nROGER\n(already almost asleep)\nOkay, dad. I missed you.\nDAD\n(confused)\nMissed me? I was just in my room\nthe whole night.\nROGER\nYeah, I know.\nDad smiles and tousles Roger's hair.\nDAD\nAll right, I'll see you when you\nget up.\nThe boys are fast asleep. Dad draws the curtains and leaves\nthe room, shutting the door gently.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. ABOVE THE FOREST - DAY\nPercy soars high above the trees, swooping this way and that\nto catch the wind. He flies by the house, and then flaps hard\nand goes sailing off in the distance to explore his new home.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n91."}

All three are in some state of controlled\ndisarray, and LUKE sips a milkshake while slouched down in\nhis seat, implicity under the influence of drugs (most likely\nmarijuana). MARCUS and HORATIO are intently and energetically\nexplaining something to him.\nMARCUS:\nOkay, look. This book says that\nPlato taught about the golden key\nto the universe that solved all the\nmysteries. But, in order to\nunderstand that key, you have to\nunderstand ratio, and proportion.\nSeparate parts come together to\nmake a whole, but understanding how\nthey come together is the trick.\nHORATIO:\nRight. So think about this. I give\nyou a line and tell you to cut it\nunevenly.\nLUKE:\nWhy.\nHORATIO:\nBecause if you cut it unevenly then\nthe ratio would be one to one, and\nhalf to the whole is one to two.\nYou can't have a proportion with\nuneven ratios.\nMARCUS:\nThe golden ratio solves that\nthough. The whole to the longer\nsegment equals the longer segment\nto the shorter.\nLUKE:\nOkay. But why the line why not just\nfractions.\nHORATIO:\nToo complex. The actual numerical\nvalue of the golden ratio is\nridiculous.\n(CONTINUED)\nMARCUS:\nA line works best, but you could do\nit with anything of two or three\ndimensions, hypothetically. You\ncould use a dachsund if you wanted.\nHORATIO:\nAnyway...you can take this golden\nratio and apply it to basic two\ndimensional shapes, to make golden\nspirals.\nMARCUS:\nIt shows up in hurricane clouds,\nDNA nucleotides, the swirl of cream\nin your coffee.\nHORATIO:\nI see it as proof that there is a\nhigher level of organization in all\nthis. Life is immeasurably more\ncomplex than anything we as humans\ncan conceive, at least at this\npoint in our evolutionary career.\nThis is the tip of the tip of the\niceberg.\nThe door of the diner bangs open loudly, and a group of 20-25\nyear olds come in. They go to the bar, and rudely order\ndrinks, hitting on the bartender etc. They all have very loud\nScottish accents, and continue to be obnoxious as they wait\nfor their orders.\nMARCUS:\nWhat have we here...\nMARCUS looks at HORATIO, who nods. They get up and head\ntowards the group out of the frame, leaving LUKE idly sipping\nmilkshake and watching.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\n(tapping one of them on the\nshoulder)\nIs that..?\nThe man turns around in surprise.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nHey! Sick Boy, it is you!\nThe rest of them turn around to see what's going on.\n2.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nHoly shit, the gang's all here,\nHoratio. You must be Renton, and\nthere's Spud of course.\nMARCUS turns to the leader of the group, the loudest and the\nrudest.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nAnd you must be Begbie!\nWith the last word, MARCUS winds up and kicks him in the\ncrotch. A brawl ensues over \"Same in the End\" by Sublime. The\nfight continues; after a moment, Luke gets up from his seat,\npicks up a chair and smashes it on the back of one of the\nmen. Freeze frame on Luke as the chair splinters on the man's\nback. There is an uncharacteristic look of fury on his face.\nNARRATOR:\nMy life wasn't always like this.\nCut to.int.a large auditorium.\nA small boy is playing a very beautiful piece on the piano.\nThe seats are full of smiling adults. The camera pans over\nthem as the music plays flawlessly.\nCUT TO: The boy playing piano. He is about six or seven, and\nis dressed in a very uncomfortable suit.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nThis is me at my first piano\nrecital. I am six years old, and\nwould rather be anywhere else in\nthe entire world.\nHe finishes the piece perfectly and the audience applauds. He\ngets up from the piano and hurriedly exits the stage.\nCUT TO: Backstage. He pulls off his blazer and sits on the\nfloor, leaning against the wall. He pulls out a CD player and\nputs on the headphones. \"Karma Police\" by Radiohead begins\nplaying softly.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nSince I was very young, music had\nprovided me with a special shelter\nthat I sought often. My crippling\nanxiety was soothed by the flowing\nmelodies, and the beauty carried me\naway every time.\n3.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(CONTINUED)\nAs the narrator speaks this last line, the camera pans up\nabove the child's head and fades to black, coinciding with\nthe drum hit introducing the verse of \"Karma Police\". The\nblack fade becomes a starry night sky over a sparkling city\nat night. Young Luke comes into the frame flying like\nsuperman. Wind whips his face as he flies above the city.\nClose-up of his face as the wind blows his hair; his eyes are\nclosed in an expression of pure ecstasy.\nCUT TO: Backstage again. Slow zoom on his face. He is\nperfectly content and calm.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nYou see, this way once they find\nme...I won't be there at all.\nOpening titles over montage of Luke flying through the sky,\nswooping down through the city.\nCUT TO: The outside lobby. A horde of chattering adults\nawaits.\nCUT TO: Young Luke sitting backstage.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nI have left the building.\nCUT TO: A teenager's bedroom. Posters of Bob Dylan, John\nLennon, etc. line the walls. Teenage Luke sits at a desk with\na computer. He is on the phone, clearly distraught.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nThis is me many years later. I was\nin love with a girl, and for a\nwhile, she loved me back. Julia.\nLUKE:\n(on the phone)\nWell, yeah...yes I know I told you\nto think about it while you were in\nSpain. Look, I just think we should\nhave the summer together. Okay,\nbut...just wait a minute...why\nthough? I just don't think it's the\nright thing to do yet. Look I don't\nknow it just does! I haven't even\ngiven you your birthday presents\nyet!\n4.\nCONTINUED: (3)\n(CONTINUED)\nNARRATOR:\nPitifully enough, I had gone to the\ntrouble of compiling a list of her\nfavorite jazz tunes, then learning\nand recording the parts on each\ninstrument. By the time I was\nfinished with the project, she no\nlonger loved me.\nLUKE:\nWell...is that it? That's it. Can I\nsee you anymore? But come on, I\nlove you!\nHe looks at the phone. She has hung up.\nLUKE: (CONT'D)\nShit.\nNARRATOR:\nStill, I clung to music as a source\nof revival and refuge.\nCUT TO: Shot of Teenage Luke sitting on a couch with a look\nof deep concentration on his face. He is intently writing in\na notebook.\nCUT TO: The page with his hand and pen in the frame. Very\nneatly and deliberately he is illustrating a circle of\nfifths. A tear or two drops on the page.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nI was 17 then.\nEXT.A BUSY CITY.DAY.\nLuke, older, but still quite youthful bicycling though busy\ncity streets, weaving through traffic.\nNARRATOR:\nI had always wanted to be a film\nscore composer, and through college\nI had done my best to hone my\ntechnique. I got sidetracked along\nthe way though...I was working a\nstiff job at my dad's office, each\nday losing a little bit more of my\nsoul.\nLuke pulls up outside the office. It is a generic building,\nwith neatly cut grass outside. He locks his bike in the rack,\ntakes off his helmet, and goes inside.\n5.\nCONTINUED: (4)\n(CONTINUED)\nCUT TO: The lobby inside. An older, stern-looking\nreceptionist.\nLUKE:\n(somewhat irritably)\nGood morning, Pam.\nPAM:\nHi Lucas. Nice to see you here on\ntime.\nLuke rolls his eyes as he walks past.\nLUKE:\nYeah, yeah.\nHe walks down the hall and opens the door to an office, going\nin. There is nothing remarkable about it, and is furnished\nwith the standard desk, chair, and file cabinets. It comes as\nno surprise that Luke dreads spending time in such a mundane\nenvironment all day. The only touch of color in the room\ncomes from a Mondrian art print hanging on the wall. Luke\ngoes behind his desk and slumps down in the chair, turning to\nlook at the art print intently. He is clearly not interested\nin doing any work. The door opens, and his dad comes in. He\nis about 60, and wears a respectable but modest suit.\nDAD:\nGood morning, Lucas.\nLUKE:\nHi dad.\nDAD:\nHow are you feeling?\nLUKE:\n(shrugging)\nCan't complain, I guess.\nDAD:\nHave you spoken to the counselor\nrecently.\nLUKE:\nYes, dad. We both know I'm doing\nfine.\nDAD:\nSure, sure. You're right. You know\nit's all in the interest of your\nwell-being, Lucas.\n6.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE:\nYeah, dad, I know.\nDAD:\nHave you been doing any writing.\nLUKE:\nSometimes. You know how it is\nthough, who has time?\nDAD:\nI know. Keep at it though. I was\nalways so proud to have a real\nwriter in the family.\nLUKE:\nDad..come on now, I'm no more of a\nreal writer than anyone else with a\npen and paper.\nDAD:\nYou always had a gift with words,\nLucas, that's real.\nLUKE:\nI don't know.\nDAD:\nHow's the apartment?\nLUKE:\nAh, you know. A little cluttered\nbut it's cozy and private. That's\nall I need, really.\nDAD:\nGood. Can I take you out for some\nlunch today?\nLUKE:\nSure, dad.\nDAD:\nSee you then.\nHe leaves, shutting the door gently. Luke is clearly\nexasperated, but holds it in and relaxes in his chair.\nNARRATOR:\nIt was going to be a very long day.\n7.\nCONTINUED: (2)\nINT.A CLUTTERED APARTMENT.NIGHT.\nLuke's apartment. It is relatively dark and gloomy, a trait\nthat is greatly deepened by the night. There are few traces\nof decoration or comfort, save for a few threadbare pieces of\nfurniture, an old TV, etc. A grimy mirror hangs in the front\nhall over a small table.\nA haggard looking Luke opens the door to his apartment and\nputs his keys on the table, taking off his coat. He looks\ninto the mirror. The camera pans around as he looks at\nhimself in the mirror, rubbing his face.\nNARRATOR:\nAt night, I though about Julia. I\nwanted to let her go so badly.\nDespite the years that had passed,\nshe stayed on my mind constantly.\nThe perfection of what we once had,\nand what we could have had, ate at\nme. There was once a time when I\ncould grasp the abstract, and I\ncould feel the blood pumping\nthrough my veins. When she left, I\nfound myself unable to maintain\nthat ability. I struggled to find\nanother way; I turned to my vices.\nLooks deeply into the mirror once more, then exits.\nCUT TO: A bedroom in the apartment. P.O.V. of the ceiling fan\nas it spins lazily. Luke opens the door and walks in, turns,\nand shuts the door, leaning against it. He moves to sit at\nthe bed, and pulls several pills out of his pocket. After\nlooking at them for a moment, he pops them all in. The drugs\ntake effect slowly.\nCUT TO: Bird's-eye view over the bed. \"Inside a Break\" by\nJohn Frusciante begins playing. Luke collapses on his back,\nlooking up at the ceiling. Lying on the bed, he dazedly looks\naround the room and sees a beautiful girl coming towards him\nfrom the doorway. She shimmers, and to the audience it is\nclearly a hallucination. She is pale and ghostly, and slowly\nshe approaches him. He sighs in delight.\nCUT TO: Side shot of Luke lying on the bed. She climbs atop\nhim slowly and gracefully. She looks like an angel. Poised\nover his chest, she caresses his cheek, and he closes his\neyes in pleasure. She leans down, and they kiss deeply. He\nembraces her in bliss, and they roll over together. However,\nas he rolls over, he suddenly finds that he is embracing\nnothing at all.\n8.\n(CONTINUED)\nHe gets up in despair, and stumbles around as the room swirls\nabout him. The lines of a Jackson Pollock art print on the\nwall appear to writhe like thousands of thin snakes.\nFrightened, he moves to the window and desperately looks out.\nCUT TO: Shot from outside viewing Luke as he looks out the\nwindow sadly.\nCUT TO: The bedroom. He turns back inside, leans back against\nthe wall, and slides down to the floor. He buries his head in\nhis arms.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nI had replaced the sweet taste of\nher lips with the feverish\nfantasies of my own mind. If only I\ncould let her go.\nINT.THE BEDROOM.MORNING.\nSunlight is streaming in the window onto the unconscious form\nof Luke. Sheets are scattered everywhere, and the room is in\na state of disarray congruent to the mental anguish of the\nnight before. He slowly begins to stir.\nCUT TO: Close-up of his eye. It snaps open suddenly.\nNARRATOR:\nI needed to see Brian.\nMontage of Luke getting up, getting his act together over\n\"Stumped\" by Minor Threat. He changes his clothes, which he\nhad slept in from the night before, takes a shower, and gets\ndressed. He looks much fresher, but the exhaustion is still\napparent in his eyes. He makes some coffee and eggs for\nbreakfast.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nBrian was my wiseman. We had known\neach other for many years while in\nschool, but it remained clear that\nhe knew a lot more about me than I\nknew about him. He had a tremendous\naura of mysticism about him that\nwas no bullshit, and I sought his\nguidance in only the most dire of\nsituations. Currently, my past was\nmaking a concentrated effort to\ncompletely devour my present and\nfuture, and I needed help. It was\ntime to take a trip.\n9.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nCUT TO: Close-up of Luke's mouth and chin. He opens his mouth\nand pops in two capsules over \"Breakfast with Blockhead\" by\nAesop Rock.\nCUT TO: Car on the highway. It is a slightly beat up SUV, and\nfor some reason the trunk is open.\nCUT TO: INT. Luke is in the car driving. He nervously taps\nhis fingers on the steering wheel. He is slouched down,\nlooking the same way he did in the diner. He is unshaven and\nwearing a track jacket.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nBrian was at Brown, which was where\nI needed to be as soon as possible.\nLuckily I was making good time on\nthe highway.\nCUT TO: Red and blue lights flashing in the rearview mirror.\nHe pulls over to the side of the road and the cop pulls\nbehind him.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nToo good.\nLUKE:\nFuck!\nCUT TO: EXT. The officer approaches the car from the side. He\nis all business, and wears the widebrim hat of the state\npolice, as well as menacing sunglasses.\nNARRATOR:\nThe first scene of Stephen King's\n\"Desperation\" immediately flashed\ninto my mind. I got nervous.\nLuke shudders.\nCUT TO: The officer's reflection in the driver's side window.\nLuke rolls it down.\nLUKE:\n(unsteadily)\nMorning, officer.\nOFFICER:\nMorning fuckstick! Any idea why I\npulled this shitbox over?\n10.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE:\n(completely taken aback)\nUh...\nOFFICER:\nOf course you don't know, you\nfucking idiot. Your trunk is wide\nopen and all your shit is falling\nout over my beautiful highway!\nLuke looks back. The trunk is indeed wide open, and papers\nare softly billowing around the back and out into the\nhighway.\nNARRATOR:\nThe bastard wasn't lying.\nOFFICER:\nNow here's what I can do. I can\neither fine you $100 for each scrap\nof paper that has fluttered out of\nyour car, or I can let you go and\npick it all up right now.\nLuke looks back again. Paper is fluttering all over. He looks\nahead and sighs.\nNARRATOR:\nThere was a lot of paper.\nCUT TO: EXT. The highway. Luke walks around with a trash bag\npicking up paper and other odd items from the road.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nTime I had. Money I didn't. I would\nhave to wait until that evening to\nsee Brian.\nCUT TO: View of Luke's face squinting in the sun as he picks\nup a page and looks at it. They all have typewriter typing on\nthem. It is a screenplay. He reads one page reflectively, and\nhis face remains stoic.\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\nThe typed pages that now lay all\naround me feet comprised a\nscreenplay that I had written. It\nwas about a woman named Jacqueline\nwho didn't really love her husband.\nIt was unoriginal shit though.\n11.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(MORE)\n(CONTINUED)\nMy friend Claudius liked it, but he\nwas dead now. His nephew stabbed\nhim. So it goes.\nEXT.A COLLEGE DORM AT BROWN.NIGHT.\nLuke's car pulls into the dimly lit parking lot of a dorm\nbuilding. Sitting in his car, he takes out a cell phone and\ndials a number.\nLUKE:\n(exhaustedly)\nHey, I'm here.\nHe hands up and gets out of the car wearing a backpack. A\nyoung man BRIAN meets him at the door. Brian has piercing\nblue eyes. They exchange a solemn greeting.\nBRIAN:\nHow are you?\nLUKE:\nVery tired. What a long strange\ntrip it's been and all that.\nBRIAN:\nWell, come in. I've got the futon\nmade up.\nThey head inside. Luke is clearly exhausted, indicated by his\nslumped posture, haggard eyes, and emaciated form. Brian is\nbright-eyed, very calm, very awake, composed, and generally\nwell-put together, providing an effective contrast to Luke.\nThey disappear through the door.\nINT.BRIAN'S DORM.NIGHT.\nIt is very peaceful in the room. There is an oriental rug on\nthe floor, a tea kettle sitting on top of the mini-fridge, a\nposter of the Dalai Lama, incense, etc. Everything is in its\nplace and as it should be, much reflecting the mental state\nof its occupant. Brian pours tea for them both. He sits in an\narmchair next to a lava lamp, which casts red-tinted shadows\non the wall.\nBRIAN:\nWhat's troubling you.\nLUKE:\n(sipping his tea)\nThe past is devouring my present\nand future. It sucks.\n12.\nCONTINUED: (3)\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\n(CONTINUED)\nBRIAN:\nAh. An issue of time.\nLUKE:\nWell, yes...in a way. It's like I'm\ndevolving. Over time, the things\nthat I used to be good at have\nbegun to fade, and these tragic\nthings that happen to me scrub out\npast experiences, leaving a void.\nBRIAN:\nWhat tragic things?\nLUKE:\nJulia leaving was the first one.\nBRIAN:\nAnd what has come of it?\nLUKE:\nWell. I wake up some mornings and\nI'm unbearably lonely. And I think\nabout how I would literally give\nanything to kiss her again. But\nsometimes it's nice. I can hang out\nwith Marcus and Horatio and get\nstoned and play with air rifles and\ntalk about how amazing it would be\nto fuck Elastigirl...\nBRIAN:\nFrom 'The Incredibles'?\nLUKE:\nYeah.\nBRIAN:\nGo on.\nLUKE:\nAnd I can do all that and not dread\nthe phone call. I can avoid that\nwhole dilemma of 'do I pick up?',\nand if I do, do I leave the room\nand talk? Or do I explain that I'm\nwith friends and can't talk? And so\non and so forth. But I know that\ngetting through that was worth it\nevery time.\n13.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nBRIAN:\nDo you miss her now?\nLUKE:\nI miss who she used to be, you\nknow? She's not the same person\nanymore. And I'm not in love with\nthat person. The love we shared\nleft an imprint on me, but it can't\nsustain itself. I need to apply it\nto new love or I feel like I'll\nnever grow, and the past will\nconquer everything I have for good.\nShe's going out with some douche\nbag from Princeton though, and I\ndon't think the odds of her\nreturning to the beauty of her past\nself are terribly good.\nBRIAN:\nWell, either way you look at it,\nshe lost that love too. I know she\nloved you as deeply as you loved\nher, and she didn't get away scotfree, as you may think.\nLUKE:\nTrue. But regardless, looking at it\nobjectively, it's hard for me to\ncare. It's like trying to suddenly\ncare about a stranger.\nBRIAN:\nI see.\nLUKE:\nIt's like in 'Shaun of the Dead',\nyou know? When Philip gets bitten,\nand becomes one of the undead, and\nShaun shouts to Barbara as they're\nescaping, [accent] 'Mum, there is\nnothing of the man you loved inside\nthat car!'. The girl I loved has\nleft the building, and the amount\nthat I loved her in the past is the\nexact same amount of fervor with\nwhich my present and future are\nbeing destroyed.\nBRIAN:\nYou have to fight back. Haven't you\nheard of 'fight the future'?\n14.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE:\nOf course, X-files.\nBRIAN:\nAbsolutely. But here it's fight the\npast, because it's attacking. And\nif it wins, God only knows what\nwill comprise the rest of your\nlife.\nLUKE:\nI don't know what to do though.\nBRIAN:\nYou need to stop the cycle it's\ncreating. You have to find love\nagain and negate the tragic things\nthat are happening. Write. Read.\nMake and listen to music. Find the\nbeauty in the world that you forgot\nabout since Julia left. And then\nyou'll start moving forward again.\nBRIAN: (CONT'D)\n(notices Luke looking\ndoubtful)\nHey, I know it won't be easy. But\ntime changes everything, my friend.\nIt's up to no one but you to steer\nthe change in the right direction.\nBrian pours more tea and they sit, sipping tea and\ncontemplating.\nNARRATOR:\nHe was right. But part of me still\nfelt like Billy Pilgrim, trapped on\na flatcar with my eye to the metal\ntube, watching helplessly as I\nhurtled toward the dismal years\nahead. But I knew I could turn it\nif I tried.\nShot of the lava lamp. Fade to black.\nEXT.THE DORM BUILDING.MORNING.\nLuke exits the building and heads out to his car, with Brian\nin tow. They get to his car to say goodbye, and Brian\nembraces him firmly.\n15.\nCONTINUED: (3)\n(CONTINUED)\nBRIAN:\nBe well, Lucas. Remember, I know\nhow you feel, but trust me, you are\nnot Billy Pilgrim.\nNARRATOR:\nHow the fuck did he get in my\nhead...?\nLUKE:\nI know, I think.\nBRIAN:\nYou'll see. Time is the most\npowerful force of change in the\nuniverse, but you can harness it,\ntrust me.\nLUKE:\nThanks Brian. You're a lifesaver.\nThey exchange their last goodbyes, and Luke gets in the car.\nEXT.A LARGE RAMSHACKLE HOUSE.DAY.\nThe house is badly in need of repair, as well as a few coats\nof paint. The shutters hang haphazardly, and a stray cat\ncurls around a post by the stairs.\nNARRATOR:\nIn such times of uncertainty, it\ncan always be comforting to settle\ninto some old routines. Just while\nyou gather your thoughts, anyway.\nLuke gets out of his car and heads toward the front door.\nSuddenly the door swings open to reveal HORATIO. He is\njubilant. He comes out to greet Luke.\nHORATIO:\n(singing)\nOh, baby if I was a catfish,\nswimmin' in the deep blue sea,\nlord, if I was a catfish...swimmin'\nin the deep blue sea.\nMARCUS:\n(shouting from inside)\nWould you be quiet? You'll scare\naway the squirrel.\n16.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE:\nSquirrel?\nHORATIO:\nOh yeah, he's been trying to get\nthis squirrel with an air rifle for\ndays now. He never hits it though.\nHe's an idiot.\nLUKE:\nWe all gotta burn something.\nHORATIO:\nYeah, I guess you're right. Come on\nin.\nINT.A LIVING ROOM.DAY.\nHoratio and Marcus' living room. There is a worn couch, a tv,\na tank of fish, a coffee table. Despite the exterior of the\nhouse, it seems like a nice place. There are some board games\non the table, along with a stack of philosophy books. Marcus\nAurelius, Nietzsche, etc. To the side there is also a\nkitchen. A fridge covered with stickers and photos, a counter\nwith fruit on it. Books also line every free space around the\nkitchen. The place is well-lived in; comforting, secure,\ncarefree. A relaxing haven for Luke. Marcus comes to greet\nthem as Luke and Horatio enter the house. He is wearing a\nwhite t-shirt, thick glasses, shorts, flip-flops, as well as\nholding an air rifle. He slaps Luke on the shoulder.\nMARCUS:\nHello, hello my friend!\nLUKE:\nHey Horatio, I didn't know you hung\nout with Private Pyle.\nMARCUS:\nHa, ha very funny asshole. Private\nPyle was fat and didn't wear\nglasses.\nLUKE:\nWell, I can just call you Private\nJoker in that case. How are you?\nThey move to the couch and sit down. Horatio busies himself\nin the kitchen cooking lunch.\n17.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nMARCUS:\nI can't complain. Except for the\ndamn squirrel that keeps eating the\nbirdseed. You look like hell\nthough.\nLUKE:\nAh, I'm fine. I just went to see\nBrian about some things.\nMARCUS:\nStill hung up on Julia?\nLUKE:\nYeah...well...I don't know. I think\nso. It's kind of a raw train of\nthought still.\nMARCUS:\nHey, why worry. You've got\neverything you need right here.\nHORATIO:\n(from the kitchen)\nYou guys want garlic or spinach\ntortillas for the chicken wraps?\nMARCUS:\nGarlic. Keeps away the vampires.\nHere, rip this please.\nHe hands Luke an elaborately colored water pipe.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nI filled it with pineapple juice.\nIt's lovely.\nLuke drags out a deep hit from the pipe. \"5/4\" by Gorillaz\nbegins playing. Luke collapses back into the chair and\nreleases the smoke in sudden slow motion. Marcus pats him on\nthe head, laughing. Camera rapidly circles the living room.\nHoratio brings food over. They continue to pass the pipe\naround, talking, eating, and laughing. [Sped up] Marcus looks\nout the window. He picks up the air rifle and goes to the\npatio door. [Slow motion] long profile shot of Marcus as he\nlevels the rifle at the squirrel on the bird feeder, takes\ncareful aim, and fires. He misses, and the squirrel jumps\nfrom the birdfeeder and scrambles up a tree. At the pause in\n\"5/4\" at 2:02: close-up of Marcus' face contorted in\ndisbelief. 2:15: Marcus angrily shakes his fist in slow\nmotion at the squirrel, yelling.\n18.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nCUT TO: INT. Frontal shot of Luke's face staring ahead. Timelapse as Horatio and Marcus gesture, laugh, talk and walk\naround him. The camera remains on his face. There is a smile\non his lips. The song ends.\nNARRATOR:\nSame as it ever was. Same as it\never was.\nTime returns to normal. Marcus, Horatio, and Luke sit around\nin the living room idly watching tv, smoking, etc.\nMARCUS:\nIt's good that you're here, Luke.\nHoratio and I have a little\nsomething we've been working on.\nLUKE:\n(still slightly stoned)\nOh?\nHORATIO:\nYeah. A little scheme we cooked up,\nyou might say.\nMARCUS:\nYou are aware of the card games\nTybalt has been holding down at the\nPen?\nEXT.A SEEDY NIGHTCLUB.NIGHT.\nCUT TO: INT. Several men sit around a table. \"Spanish Key\" by\nMiles Davis plays. The air is filled with smoke. Cards and\nchips litter the table. At the head of the table sits an\nimpressive looking man wearing a cap, shirt, tie, etc. Very\nsharply dressed. His sleeves are rolled up and he is\nconstantly grinning, looking around. He grins like a wolf.\nThis is TYBALT. The camera does a quick zoom on his face,\nthen slows down as he continues to look around, with smoke\ntrailing around his face. He hardly blinks at all, and his\neyes are the most piercing shade of blue you can imagine. His\ngaze cuts through everything and everyone.\nNARRATOR:\nTybalt was the charismatic owner of\nthe Pen club downtown. I think it\nwas left to him by his dad or\nsomething. Anyway, he held weekly\nhigh-stakes card games that well-todo riff-raff liked to buy into and\ntry and make it big.\n19.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(MORE)\n(CONTINUED)\nThousands of dollars filled the pot\neach night, but the house always\ntook home the vast majority of it.\nNo one ever complained though;\nTybalt was not one to be crossed.\nHe was like an artic wolf, and his\ngaze could cut you clean in half.\nCUT TO: INT. The living room, normal speed/sound.\nLUKE:\nYes, I am aware.\nHORATIO:\nOnce every month, the game of the\nnight is blackjack. We can count\nthose cards, Luke. Blackjack is the\nmost countable cardgame there is,\nand the fact that he only uses a\ncouple decks will make it a piece\nof cake.\nMARCUS:\nYou think about it, if we play\ncarefully, keep cool, and be smart,\nwe can away with upwards of ten\ngrand. It's a snap.\nHORATIO:\nWe want you in on it with us.\nMARCUS:\nTybalt likes fresh meat anyway.\nWith you there, he'll be focused on\ncleaning you out, while we slowly\nrake in the chips. And you can\ndrive 'cause we don't have a car.\nLUKE:\nSure, why not.\nMARCUS:\nYes! This is our best plan yet.\nHORATIO:\nIt's this Friday. You're welcome to\nstay here until then. And as long\nas you want after, for that matter.\nLUKE:\nI think I like this idea. What the\nhell, you know? This might be what\nI need to get jumpstarted.\n20.\nCONTINUED:\nNARRATOR: (CONT'D)\n(CONTINUED)\nMARCUS:\nYeah! Now why don't you go get\nsettled in your room.\nLUKE:\nOkay, I'll do that.\nLuke gets up and walks around, bumping into the coffee table\nand attempting to make his way to the room. Horatio and\nMarcus laugh and watch him leave the living room.\nCUT TO: Luke's room. He enters and collapses into bed.\nNARRATOR:\nOf course, I was not Billy Pilgrim,\njust like Brian said. I could not\nlook at my life like a mountain\nrange, nor could I understand how\nto harness time or control my\nfuture. Regardless, I did not want\nto die. I had to place my trust in\nmy friends.\nHe reaches over and switches off the light.\nINT.LUKE'S POINT OF VIEW.MORNING.\nLuke blinks his eyes open to reveal Marcus shaking him awake.\nMARCUS:\nCome on buddy, let's go get some\nbreakfast.\nLuke sleepily gets up. Marcus leaves and we hear him and\nHoratio bustling about the house.\nNARRATOR:\nI guess we had some planning to do.\nHe gets up and leaves the room.\nCUT TO: INT. Luke's car. The three characters are inside\ntalking.\nMARCUS:\nYeah, but here's my idea. You\nshould write this down, Luke, it's\nthe next big thing: a dinosaur\nmusical.\n21.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE:\nThat's the worst idea I've ever\nheard.\nMARCUS:\nNo, no! Picture it: A mama-san\nvelociraptor weeps as her sons go\noff to the frontline of the T-Rex\nwars. Meanwhile, a teenage\ntyrannosaur makes love to his\ngirlfriend one last time before\nshipping off to fight the raptors.\nLUKE:\n\"A mama-san velociraptor weeps\"?\nHORATIO:\nTyrannosaurs can't make love,\nthey're terrible lizards.\nMARCUS:\nIt gets better though. After the\ntearjerker farewell songs, maybe a\nt-rex and a velociraptor wind up\nalone together after an epic\nbattle, and they learn to respect\neach other. They realize the folly\nof their ways. The final scene\ncould be a song called \"Different\nWorlds\" or something, and the whole\ndinosaur cast would come out and\nhold hands...aw it'd be so\nbeautiful.\nSuddenly a car swerves out in front of them, skidding wildly.\nA bunch of drunken morons are yelling out the window,\ngesturing, etc. One of them throws a beer can, which\nsplatters on the windshield.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nAre you fucking kidding me?\nDream sequence (unbeknownst to audience):\nLuke floors it to get alongside the car. The idiots flip them\noff and yell curses. Luke looks at them quietly as they race\nalong side by side. Then, in a deft and sudden maneuver Luke\nyanks a gun from his jacket pocket (a la Percy killing Wild\nBill in \"The Green Mile\").\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nWhat the hell are you doing!?\n22.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nLuke fires out his window until the gun is empty. The other\ncar screeches out of control and crashes into the embankment\non the side of the highway.\nBack to reality:\nLuke shakes his head. He lifts the fold of his jacket. There\nis nothing there.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nLuke I said speed up! I want to\nthrow something at them.\nHORATIO:\nMassachussetts license plate. Big\nsurprise that is.\nLuke speeds up and Mercutio throws a water bottle or\nsomething at them, missing.\nMARCUS:\n(yelling)\nI hope you crash and burn,\nmotherfuckers! You're polluting the\nuniverse!\nThe idiots speed off, waving middle fingers and shouting.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nGod I hate scumbags like that. They\nmake me so goddamn angry.\nLUKE:\n(softly)\nMe too.\nThe car pulls into a diner. They exit the car and head\ninside.\nNARRATOR:\nPerhaps I realized then that I had\nit in me to kill a man, albeit out\nof anger. This was something new.\nThey sit down at a booth and look over the menu. The waitress\ncomes by, fills up their coffee cups. Marcus sips his deeply.\nWAITRESS:\nYou boys ready to order?\n23.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(CONTINUED)\nHORATIO:\nI'll have blueberry pancakes,\nplease.\nMARCUS:\nI'm fine with just coffee, thanks.\nLUKE:\nI'll take toast and eggs, sunny\nside up.\nWAITRESS:\n(winks at Luke)\nSure, hon. I'll have that right out\nto you.\nShe heads off.\nHORATIO:\nShe's cute!\nLUKE:\nI agree.\nMARCUS:\nOkay, okay. We need to talk. This\ngame with Tybalt could be very\ndangerous if we screw it up.\nRemember, he's like a wolf. He will\ntear you to pieces if you cross\nhim.\nLUKE:\nSo how are we going to hide the\nfact that we're cheating.\nHORATIO:\nThat's the tricky part. In a dive\nlike the Pen, counting the cards\nwill be easy. But if he catches on,\nwe could find ourselves in a world\nof shit.\nMARCUS:\nRight. We can control the game\nrelatively handily, but it will be\na matter of balance between winning\nand losing. Amongst the three of\nus, we can take home a bundle, but\nwe have to keep it subtle. Tybalt\nis as smart as he is ruthless.\n24.\nCONTINUED: (3)\n(CONTINUED)\nThe waitress brings out their food.\nWAITRESS:\nThere you are, boys.\nLUKE:\n(smiling)\nThank you!\nShe walks away. Luke and Horatio look after her longingly.\nMARCUS:\nCome on you pinheads, focus. Now,\nLuke, you don't know how to count\ncards, but...\nHORATIO:\nNot that we don't think you're\nsmart enough, of course.\nLuke shrugs.\nMARCUS:\nNo, you could handle it easily. But\nif all three of us start cruising\nthrough the hands, we'll be more\nobvious than a blink-182 lyric.\nLUKE:\nNice.\nMARCUS:\nThanks.\nHORATIO:\nLuke, you just play like you\nusually would. Luck favors Tybalt,\nand you're new so he won't spare\nyou a dime. However, Marcus and I\nwill be slowly bringing in much\nmore than you lose, so don't worry\nabout your money.\nMARCUS:\nIt's really quite simple, no real\ncareful planning necessary. It's\nnot exactly a diamond heist. Just\nbe calm, be cool, and don't say\nanything stupid.\n25.\nCONTINUED: (4)\n(CONTINUED)\nHORATIO:\nThere will be plenty of other guys\nthere so he isn't going to pay much\nattention to us anyway. When he\nstarts to look our way after we've\nbeen winning a fair amount, then\nwe'll have to be especially\ncareful.\nMARCUS:\nHe's a powerful man and won't\nhesitate to act on suspicions.\nHORATIO:\nWe keep it cool and take it easy.\nHe'll call the last hand, which\nwe'll play accordingly. Then the\ngame will be over and we take off\nwith the cash, never to play at the\nPen again, of course.\nMARCUS:\nDon't talk to anyone as we're\nleaving, we just leave. Piece of\ncake.\nLUKE:\nSounds simple enough.\nHORATIO:\nIndeed it does. With a little luck\nwe'll be rich by this time\ntomorrow.\nThe waitress comes by and drops off the check.\nWAITRESS:\nYou boys have a good day now. Be\nsafe.\nShe smiles again at Luke.\nLUKE:\nWe surely will. Thank you so much.\nShe walks away. They reach in their pockets for cash and put\nit together in a pile to pay the bill (foreshadowing of the\npot at the blackjack game). Overhead shot of them pushing\ntheir money into the center. Luke and Horatio look at the\npile of cash, silently counting it. They look up at Marcus.\n26.\nCONTINUED: (5)\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE: (CONT'D)\nDon't tell me you're one of those\nguys who doesn't tip.\nMARCUS:\nWell, not today. It's not that I\ndon't believe in it, and she was\nkind of cute. But while she was\nhaving eye-intercourse with you,\nLucas, she neglected to fill my\ncoffee more than once.\nHORATIO:\nYeah, yeah, we've all heard that\none before. We're coming back here\ntomorrow with that cash and giving\nher a massive tip to make up for\nyour rudeness today.\nMARCUS:\nFine by me. Don't count your eggs\nbefore they hatch though, all\nright? We don't need any jinxes.\nLUKE:\nLet's go.\nThey leave the money on the table and exit over \"Sailin' On\"\nby Bad Brains. Shot of them driving home on the highway.\nNARRATOR:\nIt felt surreal. For the first time\nin a while, I was actually\ncompletely in the dark as to what\nmight happen in my near future. In\nthe past I always had some idea of\nwhat might happen the next day.\nSchool...work...Julia...now\nnothing. Of course, I couldn't see\nthe future then, but it was the\ndifference between having slightly\nadjust your eyes in a darkened\nbedroom, to swimming the ocean at\nmidnight with them shut. I couldn't\nsee a thing. It was tremendously\ninvigorating.\nFADE OUT.\n27.\nCONTINUED: (6)\nEXT.THE HOUSE OF MARCUS AND HORATIO.NIGHT.\nThe three characters come out the door of the front, having\nchanged their clothes, wearing a look of somber resolve, and\ngenerally looking pretty badass. They pause as they come up\nto the camera and turn to one another.\nMARCUS:\nNow, is there anything we need to\ngo over before we do this?\nLUKE:\nDon't draw attention to ourselves.\nHORATIO:\nSubtle, calm, cool, collected.\nMARCUS:\nPrecisely. We're gonna be just fine\nboys.\nINT.THE SMOKEY BACKROOM OF THE PEN.NIGHT\nSmoke billows around a card table in the Pen nightclub.\nTybalt sits at the head of the table, as in the flashback.\nAll the other players (thuggish types) are turned to look at\nour heroes, following the piercing gaze of Tybalt.\nMARCUS:\n(in disbelief)\nWhat the fuck do you mean, I'm\ncheating?\nTYBALT:\nYou, my friend, have really got\nsome balls to come into my club and\nactually try to swindle me. It\nseems, however, that you have\nsorely underestimated my vigilance.\nMARCUS:\n(looking for a way out)\nLook, asshole, you've got the wrong\nidea. Now I think we're just going\nto leave, okay?\nHe gets up. Tybalt immediately gets up to, followed by\neveryone else at the table.\nTYBALT:\nSomething tells me otherwise, my\nfriend. The game is just beginning.\n28.\n(CONTINUED)\nHe moves close to Marcus, in his face now. Horatio and Luke\nstand a bit behind Marcus. The tension is palpable.\nTYBALT: (CONT'D)\nI suggest you and your friends take\na seat and finish the card game,\nbefore I lose my temper.\nMARCUS:\nGet bent. We're leaving.\nTYBALT:\nIf you insist. As host, however, I\nfeel that it is my duty to send you\non your way properly.\nIn a lightning quick series of shots, Tybalt thrusts a\nswitchblade into Marcus stomach. He gasps in pain and\nsurprise, and he collapses into Horatio's arms with a look of\nhorror in his eyes. Tybalt smiles.\nTYBALT: (CONT'D)\nCiao, amici.\nHORATIO:\n(desperately)\nLuke, help me get him to the car!\nPanicked, Horatio and Luke carry Marcus out to the car. He is\ngasping for air and is bleeding badly, as well as clearly\nbeing in a tremendous amount of pain. Horatio gets in the\nbackseat with Marcus, and Luke hurriedly gets in the driver's\nseat, fumbling with they keys. He starts the car.\nHORATIO: (CONT'D)\nThe hospital, now!\nMARCUS:\n(gasping)\nNo! Wait, we can't just leave.\nLuke is hesitant. He looks back at Horatio.\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nListen to me! There's a knife in\nthe glove compartment.\nLuke takes it out, and looks at it in his hand as Marcus\ncoughs and sputters in the backseat. Horatio attempts to calm\nhim down.\n29.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nMARCUS: (CONT'D)\nGo back, Luke, go back for Tybalt.\nNARRATOR:\nAgain I found myself asking the\nsame question. Was this the\ndirection my life was meant to\ntake? I tried to decide whether I\neven cared anymore.\nLuke looks back at Marcus with sadness in his eyes.\nLUKE:\nOkay.\nLuke gets out of the car and strides purposefully towards the\nback entrance of the Pen towards the back door they came out\nof.\nINT.THE CARD ROOM\nLuke enters. The card players look up from their game.\nCamera pans quickly to Luke standing in the doorway. Tybalt\ncomes up to him.\nTYBALT:\nListen friend, I suggest you leave\nlest you end up like your fierytongued comrade.\nSuddenly, without a word and with deadly force, Luke pulls\nthe knife out and shoves it into Tybalt's stomach. Tybalt\nclutches his stomach and stumbles backwards. Luke is gone\nbefore he hits the floor, and the evil cronies scramble to\nchase him over \"Travis Bickle\" by Rancid.\nCUT TO: INT. The car. Luke, who clearly sprinted to get\nthere, slames open the car door and gets in the driver's\nseat. He floors it and they take off. The adrenaline has\ntaken over.\nLUKE:\nOh, shit, shit, shit!\nHORATIO:\nDid you kill him?\nLUKE:\nYes, I mean, I think so!\n30.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(CONTINUED)\nThe car is cruising along when suddenly 2 more cars come\nspeeding up behind them.\nHORATIO:\nLose them, Luke! Jesus, Marcus is\ngoing to die.\nLUKE:\nWe're ALL going to die, Horatio!\nCar chase sequence ensues as the music roars. The rear\nwindshield suddenly shatters, having been hit by a bullet\nfrom the pursuers. Luke swerves around cars ahead, attempting\nto lose them. One of the cars doesn't make the turn and slams\ninto a building.\nMARCUS:\nAh God, it hurts, it hurts!\nHORATIO:\nBe quiet, Marcus!\nThey lose the remaining car.\nMARCUS:\n(weakly)\nPlease take me home now?\nLUKE:\nWe're going, we're going.\nEXT.MARCUS AND HORATIO'S HOUSE.NIGHT.\nLuke's car hurriedly pulls into the driveway. The car shuts\noff, and Horatio and Luke frantically remove Marcus from the\nbackseat, painstakingly carrying him up the stairs and into\nthe house.\nCUT TO: INT. The house. It is dark, and Horatio runs to\nswitch the light on. When it comes on, we see Luke holding\nMarcus in his arms. There is a great deal of blood on both\ntheir clothes, clearly coming from a wound in Marcus'\nstomach. Horatio runs over to help, and they move him to the\ncouch and lie him down. Marcus' strength is clearly waning;\nhe can barely lift his own head up, and blood is visible in\nhis mouth. He gropes at Luke desperately trying to sustain\nconsciousness.\nHORATIO:\nLuke, he needs to get to hospital.\n31.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE:\nWe can't take him there, the police\nwill be everywhere!\nMARCUS:\nHe...he's right, we'll be caught.\nLUKE:\nIf not by the police, then Tybalt's\ngoons.\nHORATIO:\nBut...\nMARCUS:\nHoratio. I'm not going anywhere.\nRelax.\nHe grips Luke's hand. Horatio is clearly on the verge of\ntears, and it is clear that Marcus is not going to make it.\nMontage: Gloomy shots around the house. The tap dripping in\nthe kitchen, books spilled around the living room, etc.\nNARRATOR:\nJust like Brian warned would\nhappen, I had let time have its own\nway, and I had lost all control as\na result. I was an empty vessel, a\nboxcar stuck on a straight track\nwith my eye glued to the steel\ntelescope.\nMarcus begins to shake. He clutches Luke's hand and we hear\nhis last gasping breaths. Fade to black as he expires.\nINT.A FUNERAL HOME.DAY\nPan shot of the funeral service. Marcus lies, his pale face\nvisible in the open casket. \"Caroline Says II\" by Lou Reed\nplays. Luke and Horatio are seated together towards the back\nin one of the pews. The place is mostly empty.\nNARRATOR:\nBut I realized then at the funeral\nthat maybe it wasn't too late. Time\nhad swept up Marcus in its\ninexorable current, but I clung to\na glimmer of hope for myself.\nPerhaps it was time to see Brian\nagain.\n32.\nCONTINUED:\nEXT.THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF HORATIO'S HOUSE.DAY.\nLuke and Horatio pull up alongside the curb in Luke's car.\nHoratio gets out and turns to look at Luke.\nHORATIO:\nWhere do we go from here?\nLUKE:\nLook, it'd be easy to give up now.\nBut maybe it's worth it to keep\ngoing.\nHORATIO:\n(mock Scottish accent)\n\"With God's help I'll conquer this\nterrible affliction\"\nLUKE:\nBest of luck, my friend.\nHORATIO:\nBye now, Lucas.\nHoratio closes the car door and turns to head to the house.\nHalfway there, he pauses and looks back sadly, but only for a\nsecond. He raises a hand to Luke, who returns the sad wave.\nLuke pulls away from the curb as Horatio continues into the\nhouse. Snow begins to fall.\nNARRATOR:\nI felt like a ragdoll being tossed\nabout by a rogue wave still. I felt\nthat if I could just my wits about\nme...just find something to focus\non, I could get the strength to\nstart paddling.\nINT.BRIAN'S DORM BUILDING.NIGHT.\nSnow has begun to fall increasingly thicker. Brian is at the\ndoor to greet Luke in the winter twilight.\nBRIAN:\nCome in, come in. It's freezing\nout.\nLuke hurries in.\nCUT TO: Int. Brian's room. He sets down a cup of tea. They\nsettle down to talk.\n33.\n(CONTINUED)\nBRIAN: (CONT'D)\nI heard about Marcus.\nLUKE:\nYeah.\nBRIAN:\nHe was pretty young, right?\nLUKE:\nYeah, he was.\nBRIAN:\nWhat can I help you with?\nLUKE:\nI don't know. I mean, my friend's\ndead, Horatio's an empty\nshell...and I just don't know what\nto do with myself at this point.\nBRIAN:\nDoes Horatio know what to do with\nhimself?\nLUKE:\nNo. I can't end up like him, Brian.\nHe and Marcus, they had a good\ntime. But they were living in a\nbubble. Just a hazy bubble that was\nimpervious to the outside world.\nMaybe that was why everything went\nto shit; Marcus dead and Horatio a\nliving ghost. They were so wrapped\nup in hiding from time that when\nthey dipped their feet in the\ncurrent, it just fucking swallowed\nthem.\nBRIAN:\nYou're still a part of it, Luke. It\nmay have devoured your friends, but\nnot you.\nLUKE:\nYeah, I know. I almost let it\nthough. I think I wanted to let it.\nBRIAN:\nDon't let it. Look, I don't know\nwhat to say to pick you up or kick\nyou in the ass and get you going.\n34.\nCONTINUED:\n(MORE)\n(CONTINUED)\nJust get it together, or trust me,\nthis world will take you down, and\nyou'll be spit out just like them.\nYou have a second chance that\nneither of them had.\nLUKE:\nYou're right. I should be on my way\nthough.\nBRIAN:\nYou're welcome to stay here, of\ncourse, but I think you know what\nyou need to do.\nLUKE:\nI hope so.\nHe gets up to leave.\nLUKE: (CONT'D)\nBye Brian. You taught me most of\nwhat I know.\nBRIAN:\nG-L-O-R-I-A spells love. Best of\nluck, Lucas.\nEXT.THE SNOWY HIGHWAY.NIGHT.\nLuke's car makes its way along the highway as snow drifts\nmove across the road. His headlights cut a figure against the\nsnow.\nNARRATOR:\nThere was still someone I needed to\nsee. Someone I needed to resolve.\nThe car pulls into a driveway of a neat-looking home. It is\nsnowing relatively hard now. Not exactly a blizzard but it's\ngetting thick. He gets out of the car and makes his way\nthrough the snow to the front door, wrapping himself tightly\nin his coat against the cold. He rings the doorbell and waits\non the doorstep. After a moment, a very beautiful young woman\nopens the door. She is roughly of the same age as Luke. She\nhas very soft eyes, and a lovely warm glow in her cheeks.\nDirector's note: Think \"Miss Cross\"/Olivia Williams from Wes\nAnderson's \"Rushmore\". It's difficult not to fall in love\nwith her at first sight. It is JULIA.\n35.\nCONTINUED: (2)\nBRIAN: (CONT'D)\n(CONTINUED)\nJULIA:\n(clearly surprised by\nLuke's arrival)\nLuke! What are you doing here?\nLUKE:\nUm, you know. I was in the\nneighborhood and I thought I'd\nswing by.\nJULIA:\n(she knows he's lying)\nCome in, it's freezing out.\nHe comes in out of the cold and she shuts the door behind\nhim.\nINT.A VERY COZY HOUSE/LIVING ROOM (JULIA'S).NIGHT\nThe interior of the house is extremely cozy and warm. There\nis a basic kitchen with a lone teapot on the stove. Some\nframed photographs line the walls and counter. They are\nmostly artistic shots: a bubbling freshwater stream, close-up\nflowers, etc. A comfortable, content place to live, in sharp\ncontrast to the loneliness of Luke's place. He rubs his hands\ntogether, regaining warmth slowly, and brushes the snow off\nhis shoulders. Julia watches him apprehensively.\nJULIA:\nAre you okay?\nLUKE:\nHuh? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I just\nwanted to stop by and see how you\nwere doing. It's been a while.\nJULIA:\nBut why?\nLUKE:\nWell...I miss you.\nJULIA:\nDo you?\nLUKE:\nWell, yeah. I mean, it's not any\nsort of desperate longing each day\nlike it used to be. But I miss the\ncontact we used to have.\n36.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nJULIA:\nI see. Let me put some tea on.\nShe sets about boiling some water while Luke looks on with a\nlook as if he's remembering the past involuntarily.\nLUKE:\n(somewhat awkwardly)\nSo...how have you been?\nJULIA:\nWell, thank you. I've just been\ngetting over this damn flu though.\nLUKE:\n(genuinely)\nI'm sorry to hear that. How are you\nfeeling now?\nJULIA:\nBetter.\nShe sets the water on and turns to face him. He has moved to\nstand much closer to her.\nLUKE:\nI was nervous about coming over\nhere, you know.\nJULIA:\nGood.\nLUKE:\nYeah. I mean, I guess it's a\nfeeling I've been getting used to.\nThings are changing.\nJULIA:\nNothing ever stays the same, Lucas.\nIt's a good thing.\nLUKE:\nI know. I guess, despite how\nunsettling it is, it's certainly\nvery healthy.\nJULIA:\nThat's true.\nThe water boils. She pours tea and they move to sit in the\nliving room, which is equally as cozy and inviting as the\nkitchen.\n37.\nCONTINUED:\n(CONTINUED)\nThey walk in holding steaming cups and sit down on the couch.\nIt seems clear that Luke has been there many times before\nfrom the way he looks around.\nJULIA: (CONT'D)\nWill you tell me why you really\ncame?\nLUKE:\nIt's just...I'm exhausted, and I\nwant to move on. I keep telling\nmyself that there's a chance we'll\nget back together someday, and I\nspend all this time thinking about\nthat and it wears me out. It wears\nme out.\nJULIA:\nWhat do you want me to say?\nLUKE:\nI don't know. It's no simple thing.\nI just want you know that I do love\nyou but I have to stop. It's\nkilling me, Jules. Because I know\nthat you don't love me.\nJULIA:\nI can't help you stop. When I\nstopped loving you, it was the\nhardest thing I ever did in my\nentire life.\nLUKE:\nBut how did you do it?\nJULIA:\n(looking deeply into his\neyes)\nI don't know, Lucas. I'll never\nknow.\nLUKE:\nI feel like I'm so close. But\nthere's so much I still don't\nunderstand. I mean, are we supposed\nto even stay in touch?\nJULIA:\n(on the verge of tears)\nI don't think so, Luke.\n38.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n(CONTINUED)\nLUKE:\nI guess maybe that's the only way.\nJULIA:\nYou still have my underwear, you\nknow.\nLUKE:\nThose were a gift, and they're safe\nin my memory box along with every\nletter and note you ever wrote me.\nI'm not going to ever forget you,\nJulia. You taught me too much.\nJULIA:\n(a tear rolls out. She\nsmiles sadly)\nOkay.\nLUKE:\nI think I'm ready to go.\nJULIA:\nI'll walk you to the door.\nThey walk out to the doorway and Luke puts on his coat and\nhis hat as he gets ready to leave. He turns to look at her\none final time. She is crying now.\nLUKE:\nYou won't hear from me anymore.\nMaybe in a long time.\nJULIA:\nMaybe so.\nLUKE:\nBye, Jules.\nJULIA:\nGoodbye, Lucas. You know how much I\nloved you.\nLUKE:\nAnd you'll probably never know how\nmuch I love you.\nThey pause for a moment, looking into each other's eyes. Luke\nthen ever so gently and lightly kisses her on the lips. Tears\nroll down her cheeks. He caresses her hair and then leaves.\nThe snow is showing no sign of letting up.\n39.\nCONTINUED: (3)\n(CONTINUED)\nCUT TO: Ext. The driveway of the house. Luke makes his way\nthrough the deepening snow and gets into his car. Rubbing his\nhands, he starts it, and pulls out.\nNARRATOR:\nEverything was okay then. I knew I\nwouldn't wind up like Marcus or\nHoratio. Living in the present, I\ncould find again the things that\nhad made me so happy as a child.\nImagination, creativity...those\nsparks of the mind that made life\nworthwhile. There was a type writer\nand a stereo waiting for me at\nhome, and I couldn't wait to turn\nthem on.\nLuke lowers his hand to the stereo and turns up the dial.\n\"Height Down\" by John Frusciante comes on. The car continues\ndown the long and winding road. Fade to black.\nTHE END.\n40.\nCONTINUED: (4)"}

APARTMENT - NIGHT\nTwo men dressed in black approach an apartment building and\nwalk up the steps of the porch to the front door. It is SAM\nNEEDHAN, a thin, dark-haired young man, and his accomplice,\nDENNIS, who is slightly taller and broader. Dennis tries the\ndoorknob, only to discover that it is locked.\nDENNIS\nIt's locked.\nSAM\nI'm pretty sure that's not right...\nshe never locks this door. Why\nshould tonight be any different?\nDENNIS\nI don't know why, but we aren't\ngetting in this way.\nSam thinks for a moment, then walks down the steps to look up\nat the second floor balcony.\nSAM\nI have an idea.\nDENNIS\nWhat, we're going to climb up\nthere?\nSAM\nWe have to. She is the one, Dennis,\nI'm sure of it.\nSam then begins to move up towards the base of the balcony,\nscaling it with relative ease. Dennis reluctantly follows,\nand they both make it over the railing and onto the balcony.\nEXT. BALCONY - NIGHT\nSam and Dennis stand on the balcony, looking at a door that\nleads directly into the apartment.\nDENNIS\nSam, wait, hold on. You realize\nyou've said that about the last\nthree girls, right? According to\nyou, they've all been the one - and\nthey've all ended up the same way.\nDid you ever stop to consider the\nfact that you might just be\naddicted to this little game?\nSAM\nI'm afraid you'll have to trust me\non this one, Dennis. She's perfect,\nI just know it.\nDennis sighs, and both men pull ski masks on, which they had\nbeen carrying in their pockets. The masks are not exactly\nordinary - they are knit with animal face designs that make\nthe two trespassers look quite terrifying in the moonlight.\nSam tests the doorknob on the balcony door, which turns\neasily. They enter the apartment.\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe apartment is dark, aside from a faint light emanating\nfrom the bathroom. The pair proceeds cautiously through,\ntaking care not to stumble into anything. They make their way\nthrough the halls of the apartment, arriving at a bedroom\ndoor that is open just a crack. Sam gently pushes it open,\nand light from the hallway spills in to reveal a beautiful\nyoung girl, LIZ, lying asleep on her bed. Sam appears visibly\nexcited, and he and Dennis exchange a triumphant look through\nthe eyes of their masks. Sam grips Dennis' shoulder with\nconfidence.\nSAM\n(whispered)\nWhat did I tell you?\nDennis gives Sam an affectionate tousle, and together they\ncreep into the room towards the sleeping Liz.\nCUT TO:\nINT. THE HALLWAY\nIn the hallway outside Liz's bedroom we hear the sounds of a\nstruggle, and then a piercing scream from Liz, which is\nabruptly cut short by one of the kidnappers. We then hear the\nfaint sound of rope being fastened around her limbs, and\nafter a moment the two men emerge from the room into the\nhallway, carrying an unconscious Liz. She has been bound by\nher hands and feet, and a black hood has been placed over her\nhead. They carry her out of frame, and leave the apartment.\nINT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT\nLIZ'S POV\nFrom under the hood, all she can see is darkness.\n2.\nSAM\nDennis, if you please...\nDennis pulls the hood off to reveal Sam sitting at the\nopposite end of a lavishly set table, dressed in a\nrespectable suit jacket and tie. Two candles burn brightly at\nthe center of the table, and a finely prepared meal is set\nout with silverware and cloth napkins alongside the plates. A\nbottle of wine stands on the table, and Dennis (who is now\ndressed in a fine collared shirt) moves to pour a glass each\nfor Sam and Liz. However, both Liz's hands and feet are tied\nto the chair, immobilizing her completely. Dennis exits the\nroom, leaving Sam alone with his captive.\nSAM (CONT'D)\nThere's that lovely face!\nLIZ\nLook, I don't know who you are or\nwhat you want but if you let me go\nnow, I swear.. no one has to know.\nSAM\nIt's so nice to have you here, as\nmy guest. I've had guests before,\ngirls mostly. In fact, the last\nyoung lady I had over...why, she up\nand ran out on me! Can you\nimagine... But you're not like the\nothers. You're sweet, and polite\nand... refined.\nLIZ\n(pleading)\nI'm not who you think I am!\nSAM\nI must say, you're by far the most\ncharming girl I've ever met. Such a\nway with words. How is the wine, by\nthe way? I haven't tried it yet\nmyself...\nSam takes a sip of his wine, savouring it.\nSAM (CONT'D)\nOh, that is quite nice! You were\nright about the aftertaste, it is\nrather smoky indeed.\nHe takes a bite of his meal, appearing not to pay attention\nto Liz for the moment.\n3.\nShe struggles against her bonds, desperately looking around\nfor something that she might use to escape. Sam laughs to\nhimself, though still not looking up.\nSAM (CONT'D)\nDon't be silly darling, you're not\nbeing rude. Not at all.\nHe looks up at her with a gaze that is both sinister and\nloving at the same time.\nSAM (CONT'D)\nAlthough, that reminds me! I have\nsomething for you.\nHe wipes his mouth with the napkin and stands up from the\ntable.\nSAM (CONT'D)\nI hope you'll forgive me if I\nexcuse myself for a moment to\nretrieve it. I'll come right back\nthough, I promise. Don't go\nanywhere, my dear, just stay right\nthere.\nSam leaves the room, and Liz immediately continues to\nstruggle against the rope. She does not appear to be having\nany success.\nINT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nSam enters his bedroom and heads straight for his dresser.\nThere is a dress neatly folded on the top surface, and he\ngently strokes it, fingering the folds. He then opens a\ndrawer and takes out a photograph of a beautiful young woman,\nwho looks strikingly similar to Liz.\nSAM\n(speaking to the photo)\nI told you she was the one. She's\nlike you in every way.\nSam then picks up a grotesque plastic animal mask from beside\nthe dresser and places it on his head. He stares at the\nphotograph a moment longer, breathing heavily. Dennis\nsuddenly appears in the doorway, already wearing his mask. He\nhands Sam a short length of rope, which Sam takes a looks at\n4.\nINT. DINING ROOM\nLiz sits at the table, still struggling with her constraints.\nAll of a sudden, the overhead lights switch off, and the only\nlight left in the room comes from the two candles burning on\nthe table. Liz's terrified face is illuminated in the\ncandlelight, and Sam and Dennis come creeping in with their\nmasks also illuminated by the flickering light. They slowly\ncircle the girl, getting closer and closer, and Sam\nbrandishes his garrote menacingly. Liz lets out a scream for\nhelp, and at that moment they pounce. There is a struggle,\nand Dennis manages to hold her down in the chair as Sam\ntwists the rope around her neck. Her cries are cut short as\nSam chokes the life out of her. They untie her hands and\nfeet, then carry the lifeless body into Sam's bedroom. We\nhear the sounds of clothing tearing and body parts being\nshuffled around.\nSAM (O.C.)\nThere. She's perfect.\nCUT TO:\nINT. SAM'S BEDROOM\nLiz's corpse is propped in an upright sitting position\nagainst the headboard of Sam's bed, looking strangely\nbeautiful. They have dressed her in the elegant flower-print\ndress that Sam had in his room, and her eyes are still wide\nopen, staring lifelessly out into space. A thin bruise\ncircles her neck. Sam and Dennis stand over her, admiring\ntheir newest decoration.\nSAM\nShe is a work of art. Nothing less,\nwouldn't you say?\nDENNIS\nShe certainly fills out the room\nnicely.\nSAM\nYou know, I think I really love her\nDennis.

They sit in silence for a moment.\nDENNIS\nI had a dream last night.\nSam looks up, interested.\nSAM\nGo on.\nDENNIS\nI was in a big metallic room\nsitting on a chair in the very\ncenter, and right in front of me\nwas this great big two-way mirror.\nI couldn't see through, but of\ncourse I knew I was being watched.\nMy arms were tied behind my back,\nand my mouth was bound but...I\nrealized there was a door off to\nthe side of the room.\n6.\n(MORE)\nLike an exit, you know? I reached\nback, and found that my hands were\nuntied, so I leapt up and dashed\nfor that door.\nAs Dennis continues to describe his dream, Liz hangs her head\nin utter defeat, sobbing quietly. Sam and Dennis appear not\nto notice at all.\nDENNIS (CONT'D)\nI went through the door and came\nout in a huge field, with long\ngrass waving about in the wind. I\ncould hear the people behind me\nalready starting to chase, so I\nstarted to run through the grass\nbut my legs were so heavy... It was\nlike I could barely move. The\nfaster I tried to run away, the\nslower I moved. That's when I knew\nI would never escape. And then I\nwoke up.\nDennis shrugs his shoulders and takes a drink of his coffee.\nSam stands up and walks over to Liz.\nSAM\nThat's fascinating, Dennis. But I\nwonder...\nHe puts a hand on the girl's shoulder, which he gently\nmassages. She shivers and gives a small whimper.\nSAM (CONT'D)\nWhat kind of dreams will she have\ntonight?\nDennis looks down into his coffee.\nDENNIS\nGod only knows, I guess.\nSAM\nRight. Give me a hand, will you?\nDennis gets up, taking the hood from the table. He slips it\non her head in a POV shot that is covered in darkness as he\npulls it down past her eyes.\nTHE END\n7.\nDENNIS (CONT'D)\n8."}

What did a few more weeks of uncertainty really matter?\n\n* * * *\n\nMilly checked the clock on the wall in the ship's little kitchenette. Just past 6 a.m. She groggily put a mug of coffee to her lips and sipped at it, reviving herself little by little. She and Jack and Sara had stayed up late with a bottle of the Captain, and the churning mid-Atlantic wasn't doing her stomach any favors.\nThe ship the three of them had chartered was called the Cassiopeia, and it was a sturdy old fishing boat that had seen at least three major overhauls in the past ten years. She belched massive wads of black smoke into the sky whenever they really needed her to haul ass, but for the most part Cassiopeia hung tough.\nThey'd entered a lottery to take part in a competition to try and catch that ... thing out there, but Milly had never dreamed they'd be selected. Come back alive and we'll give you all the gasoline you could ever hope for, along with a $5 million bonus to be divided evenly among the crew, they'd said. The energy crisis had cratered the economy, but contests like these were one way the new government kept people distracted. It provided a sense of normalcy that the near total depletion of natural resources had stripped away. Parents gathered with their children around store windows on street corners to watch the rows of television sets on display within the store, and a dozen high-tech security cameras placed strategically around the Cassiopeia beamed back a running feed of the group's efforts to catch or kill the massive creature. Only, this was no ordinary shark. The mutant Great White that was now making its way to South Africa to give birth weighed almost 30 tons, making it only slightly smaller than an average 18-wheeler.\nNevertheless, Milly remained confident in their mission, given some of the weaponry they had on board.\nJack and Sara were still in their cabin, possibly engaging in some early morning tomfoolery if they weren't too hungover, so Milly climbed back into her own sleeping quarters to change into a pair of denim cutoffs and a white t-shirt.\nJack and Sara had been together for almost a year, but Milly had seen the way he looked at her, and didn't mind the fact that he clearly fantasized about her from time to time. Not that she would ever hurt Sara. They were all too good of friends for that. Then again, you never know what can happen out on the high seas, she thought with a mischievous grin.\nA door opened, and music came crackling out of twin speakers that Jack had set up in his cabin, an old recording of \"All My Rowdy Friends Have Settled Down.\" The water lapped gently against the bow as the ship chugged along on autopilot, always straight in the direction of the homing beacon.\nJack emerged from his quarters, which were built directly above the cockpit. This gave the boat an odd, teetering quality, with its strangely high center of gravity, but it stayed on an even keel as long as you kept the prow pointed into any oncoming waves. Jack's tanned biceps flexed as he lowered himself onto the main deck to stand next to Milly. His heart beat a little faster knowing that they were alone together, since Sara was still passed out. Not that he would ever make a move of course. Of course not. Not with all those cameras around. The only places on the boat that weren't being filmed were their cabins and the water closet.\nJack forced himself to get his 27-year old libido back under control, which was no easy task given that tight low-cut top that Milly was wearing. In any case...\n\"You check the charts yet?\" he said. There was an edge to his voice, like his nerves were beginning to wear a bit thin. Time to get this show on the road.\n\"No, was just about to. I made a pot of coffee if you're interested.\"\nHe beamed at her. \"Nice! Thanks. Not sure if I'll be able to keep pace with you and Sara if every night is like that.\" He resisted winking at her. \"You think people are tuning in right now?\"\nMilly crouched down to coil some loose rope on the deck. \"Uh, yes, Jack. The whole country is watching. Not a lot of time left before the main event.\"\nJack swallowed hard. \"Jesus, you think we'll catch up with it that fast?\"\n\"We're moving at a decent clip, and that thing out there is taking its time. Based on what I calculated before we started taking shots, it's heading due southeast. We could easily see it tonight.\"\nHe looked like he had just swallowed a fly. \"At night? That would be fucked.\"\n\"Yep. You better get Sara up, my man.\"\n\"Sure, yeah. Shit, Milly, I don't know if I'm ready for this.\"\n\"Jack. You want to be rich?\"\n\"Well, I...\"\n\"Me too. Don't worry, we can handle it.\" She finished with the rope and got up, dusting off her hands. Jack couldn't help but glance at her chest. Milly pretended not to notice."}

Milly pretended not to notice.\n\n***\n\nNow, the shark did hear something. The chop of a propeller echoed through the water, and the huge beast felt the vibrations and identified them quickly as unnatural. She let her massive frame glide, no longer powering forward with the strong sweep of her tail, just listening for a moment. The day had passed uneventfully, aside from catching and shredding a huge blue tuna that had wandered away from its school at a very inopportune time (depending on which fish you asked).\nAt length, she began to propel herself through the water once more, not hearing enough to give her true concern or cause a change in course. She could not understand that the tracking device under her skin made true elusion impossible, but she feared nothing in the ocean, and would defend herself, and her unborn litter, with every ounce of the terrifying force at her disposal.\n\n***\n\nThe day had gone by far too quickly for Milly's comfort, and now they were getting very close to their target. Jack was in the cockpit, overseeing the navigation, and he kept compulsively glancing up to check a white blip on the computer monitor that told them the position of the beast. Sara had spent the day prepping the guns and ammunition, and now she sat cleaning an AK-47. The rifle's oily wooden stock and handguard gleamed in the murky evening light.\nThe sun was dipping below the horizon at a seemingly accelerated rate, and Milly zipped herself up in a crimson sweatshirt bearing a white \"H\".\n\"Milly, can you hand me that box of magazines?\" Sara asked, her voice soft and sweet, even as she spoke about ammo.\nShe carried the box over and put it down beside Sara, who sat on the floor with her legs splayed out beneath a yellow flower-print dress. Milly bit her lip as she stole a glance down the front of Sara's dress while the other woman rammed home a banana clip into the now freshly serviced Kalashnikov. Sara then got up and climbed around to the bow, where she balanced the carbine on the deck railing and lined up an imaginary target in the murky water ahead. The Cassiopeia continued forward at cruising speed, though Jack was already beginning to angle down the throttle and slow the engines. White foam churned behind the boat, settling a bit with the downshift of the engines. The blip on his screen was only 100 feet out now, and he swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly.\n\"Sara, babe, careful up there!\" he called out. Despite his wandering gaze with Milly, he loved Sara to death, and if they made it out of this thing alive, he figured he would probably propose. Nice confidence there, chief, he thought with a grimace. The cameras in the cockpit stared at him in quiet fascination, the omnipresent red recording light always glowing. He gazed back into the lens, wondering how many people were watching him right now, and if they had any idea what was going on in his sex-addled mind. Probably, dude.\nMight as well give 'em a show, he thought.\nHe cut the engines completely. \"Milly, we're gonna be right on top of it in a second, you two better be ready!\"\nMilly forced herself to stop staring at Sara's backside and ducked down to open the armory, grabbing a shotgun off the rack like she'd done it a thousand times. She racked the slide with a hearty clack that sent a shiver of anticipation through her body.\n\n***\n\nThe shark was aware that something foreign had settled in the waters above its spine. The fragrance of diesel fuel drifted through the murky depths and into her nostrils like a waft of industrial perfume. She spun in a wide circle back towards the intruder, thinking only of the precious lives contained in her womb.\nShe began to build momentum like a locomotive pulling out of the station. The shark's eyesight was perfectly serviceable in the dark, and it could already make out the wooden hull of the aggressor.\nThe behemoth cruised onward, rising to just below the surface, and closing the distance to the Cassiopeia with terrifying speed.\n\n***"}

It's going to charge the boat!\" Jack shouted from the bridge. Milly had made her way around to join her friend at the bow, ready to defy death, or welcome it, at the very end, if all efforts were to prove fruitless. At least they'd go out with a bang, one way or the other. She loved Jack and Sara, had loved them since they'd first met in college, all arguing for change that never came. Ironic that this was where their paths had led them - participants in a sick game show that pitted them against one of mother nature's great works of art. The shark that was now charging them was possibly the only one of its kind - at least the only one that had been documented as of the year 2033 - but it certainly provided ample challenge to those humans who wanted to become rich and famous in the midst of a global catastrophe.\nSara picked up a pair of night-vision goggles and slipped them down over her eyes, clicking them on with a soft electric whine. Peering into the green world that now greeted her, she could see the massive fin gliding towards their boat. She'd told herself not to panic when this moment came, and her preparedness did seem to be paying off as she stood her ground aimed carefully down the iron sights of the rifle. The fin was picking up speed however, and she wasn't sure how close it needed to be in order for the rounds to have a solid effect. Milly was going through a similar thought process beside her, gripping the 12-gauge. Jack stayed in the cabin, ready to either try and ram the beast, or gun the engines for an attempt at flight if all else failed.\nSara, feeling that she could not wait any longer, squeezed off a burst at the water immediately in front of the huge fin gliding towards them. The bullets made surprisingly tame splashes in the ocean surface, with seemingly very little effect. The fin was moving fast now, sending out a foaming white wake on either side. Milly winced against the blast from Sara's rifle, but concentrated on her aim while looking through her own set of night-vision goggles. Now, a large swath of the creature's back was actually visible, it was riding so high on the water. Its grey skin sparkled in the brightening moonlight, and Milly fired a slug into the broad section.\nAgain, the shark barely seemed to feel it, and was now within 25 feet of the boat. It had achieved maximum ramming speed, and by Milly's estimation the thing was moving about six knots, incredibly fast for a creature of such incredible mass. Jack picked up a grenade from the box on the deck, feeling its heft with one hand, his other on the steering wheel. This is it, he thought.\n\n***\n\nOut in front of an appliance store in New York City, a large crowd had gathered to watch. The cameras cut between the two women in goggles opening fire, and a low shot from a camera on the hull that showed the female great white megalodon cruising closer.\nThe crowd gasped in horror at the scene that began to unfold before their eyes.\n\n***"}

The cameras cut between the two women in goggles opening fire, and a low shot from a camera on the hull that showed the female great white megalodon cruising closer.\nThe crowd gasped in horror at the scene that began to unfold before their eyes.\n\n***\n\n\"For fuck's sake, hang onto something!\" Jack screamed. The blip was now upon them. A half second later and the ship shuddered with impact as the creature drove its snout directly into the starboard gunwale. The Cassiopeia lurched heavily to one side, and Jack knew they were already taking on water. He frantically flipped a half-dozen switches and flooded a ballast container with seawater, trying to level out the listing vessel.\nSara screamed and dropped her rifle as she grabbed out for the thin metal railing at the front of the boat, but Milly had somehow managed to keep her footing. Not only that, but she continued to pump shotgun blasts into the back of the creature, which now appeared to be ever-so-slightly stunned after slamming into the hull, which was heavily reinforced below the surface. Her fiery hair swung into her face, but she ignored it, racking the shotgun like a woman possessed. She thanked God as she looked into the muddy darkness - it seemed like the slugs were having some effect on the beast, some even managing to pierce its armor-like hide. Gouts of blood were beginning to stream from its upper head and back area. Milly moaned with delight as she continued to fire her load. In the back of her mind, she knew she was running out of shells, but the box was back with Jack in the cockpit.\nFor the first time, the fish reared its head out of the water, sending sheets of water cascading down and out of its incredible jaws. It gnashed them furiously in the night air, and the green image of this feat looked utterly surreal through Milly's goggles, enough so that she almost lost her concentration. That was when it fell back below the surface.\nIt struck again. The hull gave out a resounding crack, and Jack shouted in surprise from his post. How could the producers possibly have thought that the thin steel plates down below would have been enough to prevent a catastrophic breach in the face of such a powerful creature?\nThen again, he reflected, that could have all been just part of the plan.\nSara had just regathered her wits and was stooping over to pick up the M-16 when the impact came, catching her completely off-guard. She stumbled sideways and smacked the side of her head against the metal railing, then tumbled forward onto her stomach before rolling sideways, towards the hungry ocean - and massive great white - waiting below. Jack abandoned the steering wheel to race around the side of the boat in a desperate attempt to save her from going in the drink. As he was making his way along the narrow edge that separated the bridge from the bow, he simultaneously pulled the pin on the hand grenade he'd been carrying, and cast it down over the side. In his hurry to pull the pin, the red wool cap he'd been wearing tumbled off his head, and landed directly on the animal's heaving back. He paused ever so briefly, somehow hypnotized by this strange detail. The cap stayed there for another second before a sheet of water sent it tumbling off into the waves.\nIt was in this moment of hesitation that Sara went over the side.\nMilly screamed. The animal's jaws sent up a blinding fury of foam and black seawater as it sought its prey. Sara, who had knocked herself unconscious on the railing, floated in the water like a wilting yellow feather. The thing's jaws found a leg and pulled her down almost immediately, and then she was gone. The grenade that Jack had dropped exploded just below the surface of the ocean, delivering what seemed like a glancing blow to the side of the beast's head.\nSara's torn-apart yellow dressed bobbed to the side. There was no sign of her body, other than a gurgle of bloody foam from where the predator had been a second earlier.\n\"She's going around to the other side!\" Milly screamed, racing over to look. She was out of shells, but managed to gather up Sara's M-16. The ship was canting dangerously to starboard, and Jack knew that his chances of saving the ship were essentially nil. They had already taken on far too much water.\n\"Milly, we don't have a chance, the ship is going down. I only have a pistol with a few rounds...\" A creepy calm had entered his voice as he stood next to her on the bow that was now rapidly angling upwards. They each got a good grip on the railing to prevent themselves from tumbling straight into the thick glass of the cockpit windows. \"I think we should give up, maybe.\"\n\"Jack, we can't, I'm not giving up yet god dammit!\" Milly cried. \"Please, I need you. We can beat this thing!\"\nThen, without thinking, she stood on her toes and planted a deep kiss on his lips. She pushed her tongue into his mouth, which he responded to with a surprised kind of energy.\n\"Milly, Jesus, Sara's been dead for like 12 seconds!\"\n\"She knows I need you to help me fight. We could still make it out of here alive!\"\n\"We still have that C-4 in the weapons locker.\"\n\"Yes! You have to go get it. I'll try and distract it with small-arms fire. Go, NOW.\"\nJack felt a strong desire to live come surging back into his heart. Letting go of the railing, he stumbled backwards and almost went flying straight through the deck windows, as he had feared, but then regained his balance and went climbing around the side as he had so many times before (though under slightly less dire circumstances). Behind him, the rat-tat-tat of Milly firing M-16 rounds at the dark shape beneath the water sent a fresh surge adrenaline through his veins.\nWater was pouring over the ship's controls, and he knew he had to be careful not to electrocute himself. He moved around the sidewall and kicked open the locker, seeing at once the several packages of plastique that lined the bottom of the case. He grabbed two bricks, the necessary cables, and a detonator, and wrapped them in his shirt, which was now soaking wet. His shoulder-length black hair swung wildly in his eyes and he tried to find a handhold on something to pull himself back around to the front.\n\"Milly, I got it!\" he shouted. She looked up, and in the murky light, wearing her night-vision goggles, her flaming red hair blowing in the sea breeze, he thought she looked terribly beautiful.\nDropping to his knees on the deck, which was now pointing upward at a 45-degree angle, Jack frantically stuck two cables into the blocks of plastique and switched on the radio transmitter that would send an electrical charge into the bricks. He gripped the detonator in one hand and prepared to toss them over the side, when another devastating impact rocked them from the port side. He skidded over to the railing and through it. Milly's heart leaped into her throat.\n\"Jack!\" she screamed.\nShe looked over the side of the huge hull and there he was, dangling by one hand. The shark circled below. Its fin protruded ominously. She could not tell if it was preparing for one final, devastating blow, or if it knew that a delicious snack was hanging in the hair directly over her head. It didn't matter. Milly had emptied her magazine into the thing's back, and it appeared to have lost a great deal of energy from all the ammo she and Sara had managed to hit it with, but it was still a pure machine of lethal force.\n\"Milly... God, I can't hang on!\" Jack said through gritted teeth. In his other hand, he held the C-4 bricks and the detonator. \"Here, you have to take it! It's our only chance!\"\nShe knew he was right. \"Okay, give it to me, quick!\"\nWith his ebbing strength, he quickly reached up with his free hand and Milly snatched away the detonator. The beast reared back and stretched its jaws open to a seemingly impossible width. Milly looked on in horror; she could just make out scraps of Sara's dress still caught in its teeth.\nThat was when Jack lost his grip.\nHe screamed and fell backward into the night, still clutching the bricks of C-4 in his right hand. The great white had positioned itself almost perfectly. Jack fell straight down into its waiting jaws, which at their full extension you could have driven a mini-van comfortably into.\nJack fell directly in. One arm caught on a row of teeth and was instantly shredded as he plummeted into its throat.\n\"I always loved you, Jack,\" Milly said as a tear leaked out from beneath one eyepiece of her goggles.\nMilly took a deep breath, and squeezed the detonator."}

The boards had provided that when Archie Krieger smeared him all over the big Tim Hortons ad, angling the hard upper part of his shoulder into Paul's solar plexus.\nThe doctors told him later how lucky he'd been; the force of the impact had been enough to crack his sternum in two places, and he could have easily died out there on the ice. To their amazement, he was already up and walking just a few weeks after the injury. Prior to that, Leroux had wallowed through a black fugue state, interspersed with blurry faces and white coats coming and going from his room at random.

Archie Krieger was the hardest hitter in the league, and Paul had paid dearly for forgetting that.\n\n****\n\nThey released him from the hospital on a Tuesday, and Leroux drove the 12 miles home by himself. He was glad to get back; the townhouse apartment that the front office had set him up with was not too shabby. He shared the building with an old woman named Greta Hirschbach who kept the third floor, but the first, second, and basement were all his. Leroux pulled his Escalade into the parking space out front.\nHe got out of the car, locking it with a soft chirp, then trudged up the stone steps. Entering the kitchen, he pulled out his cell-phone and plugged it into the outlet next to the toaster. When it powered up, he went to check his voicemails. After a few from his mom, another voice came over the tinny speaker: Glen Pritchard, the Falcons' general manager.\n\"Hi Paul, Glen here. I heard you were getting released soon. When you're feeling up to it, I was hoping you might make it down to the office for a bit of a chat. I know you've had a rough few weeks, but I want to see what we can do to make the transition easier for you.\"\nThere was a long pause in the recording, and Leroux gripped the edge of the marble counter.\nTransition to what?\n\"Paul... I think you need to face the possibility that your season is over. I'd like to ... talk about your options. You got a raw deal, kid. I want us to figure something out. Meantime, get yourself some rest and give me a call when you can. You know we're all rooting for you. Bye now.\"\nSeason. Over.\nWhy didn't Glen come right out and say it was his career? Players did not usually bounce back from such traumatic brushes with death. Clint Malarchuk went back to playing goalie for the Sabres about a week after getting his throat slashed by a skate and look how well that turned out. Leroux held no illusions about the extent of his own physical damage, but only now were its real implications beginning to sink in.\nHe realized how hard he'd been gripping the counter and at last allowed his fingers to relax. His whole life he'd dreamed of making it to the NHL, and now that might be gone for good.\nWith no one around to stop him, Leroux allowed himself one generous chest-scratch. He felt the plaster tug perilously at the dozens of stitches underneath, causing him to let out a hiss of pain.\nEverything will become clearer when you talk to Glen tomorrow, he thought, trying to calm himself. That old codger usually had a few tricks up his sleeve for when players got into hot water, regardless of what kind. Pritchard had posted bail for at least ten percent of the guys on the roster, and that was just this season. Paul's case was certainly unique, but that didn't mean Glen would be any less resourceful.

He popped a couple Ibuprofen and concentrated on making his morning routine as normal as possible, although forgoing the usual push-ups and crunches for obvious reasons. He went downstairs and fried up a couple eggs, then grabbed a magnetic pad with some phone numbers off the fridge and sat down to eat.\nHe dragged his finger down the list while munching on the eggs until it came to a stop by Glen, scratched in his blocky handwriting. Swallowing the bite, he punched in the digits on his iPhone. The GM picked up on the second ring.\n\"Pritchard,\" he said.\n\"Hey, Glen, how's it going? It's Paul.\"\n\"Paul! You got my message. You're home then?\"\n\"Yeah, I was thinking I could drop by today if that works for you. Say around 12:30?\"\n\"You sure you're feeling up to it, son?\"\n\"I think so.

Come on down to my office and we'll mull things over together.\"\n\"Great, see you then.\"\n\n****\n\nPaul tried to clear his mind as he parked at the Falcons' brand-new training facility. It was a hockey oasis out in the middle of suburbia, 45 minutes north of downtown Philly. Construction on the glistening aluminum and glass building had wrapped up just last summer. Ticket sales had been surging, and the front office owed a large portion of their recent financial success to the dazzling play of Leroux himself.\nHe emerged from the black SUV and made his way through the huge glass front doors, then upstairs, around a corner, and down the hall to the GM's office. He hesitated for a moment before knocking. Some grave sense of foreboding had cast a pall over his thoughts.\nThe only way to put those fears to bed is to go in and see what he wants to talk about, ya big goddamn baby, he reflected somberly.\nHe rapped his knuckles on the door.\n\"Come in!\"\nPaul sidled in and took a seat in the high-backed leather chair in front of the boss's big desk, which was covered with framed photos of his three athletic sons, and a couple of his wife. Leroux resisted an urge to tug at his bandage, which he hadn't bothered to change that morning. He'd covered it up with a bit of Saran wrap for the shower, patting it dry afterwards, but he worried that it was starting to get a little ripe.\nGlen looked him over with a fatherly eye while reaching over the desk to shake his hand. \"Hey pal, good to see you. How's the war wound?\"\nLeroux shrugged and let his gaze drift to the office windows, which overlooked the rink. A few guys were drifting around in warm-up suits, practicing trick shots on an empty net, and trying to shatter a water bottle that they'd balanced atop one goalpost.\n\"Didn't sleep too well last night. I was glad to hear your voice when I got back from the hospital, though. Thanks for checking in.\"\nPritchard waved it off amiably. He self-consciously fiddled with a pen that bore the team's logo: a screaming falcon in full-on attack mode, talons outstretched and ready to sink into some unsuspecting prey below.\n\"I wanted to bring something up with you, see what you think,\" Glen said. \"What I'm about to tell you has to stay on the DL, so to speak, and there are no obligations, but the whole thing depends on you, and... well, now I'm rambling. I'll get to the point.\" He sighed and leaned forward.\n\"I want you to be the next assistant head coach of the Philadelphia Falcons. Your first game could be this Thursday, against Krieger and the Stonecutters,\" he said.\nThe younger man blinked. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\"I think we can salvage this season, Paul. Imagine what it would mean to the guys if you were there, lining up plays, getting their heads in the game. You'd be the youngest assistant head coach in team history, a regular shoo-in for NHL front office just a year or two from now.\"\nPaul sat back, a look of incredulity written across his face.\n\"I can't believe you're saying this. After everything we've been through, everything I've worked for, and I'm cut from the team?\"\n\"Paul, lots of guys get sidelined by a big injury early in their careers. There's no shame in it. I know how hard this must be for you, but we have to face the fact that your playing days are behind you. You've got a real good opportunity here to make something out a terrible situation.\"\n\"This is bullshit Glen, you know I can come back from this.\" He felt perilously close to tears.\n\"Please, just give it a chance. I need you behind the bench on Thursday. It's important,\" Glen said.\n\"What about Krieger?\"\n\"What about him? He got a ten game suspension. Thursday will be his first game back. We just have to accept the league's decision on that. Nothing we can do to him now, unfortunately.\" Glen suddenly put on a sly grin. \"Although, wouldn't it be nice to get some good old-fashioned payback, somehow?\"\n\"Um.. what do you mean?\"\n\"Oh you know, maybe get one of the other big guys, or somebody, to take a... I don't know, take a shot at him,\" Glen said.\nDid he just wink at me? Paul thought, staring at him.\nPaul sat there for a second, puzzled, and the two men held eye contact for the next ten seconds.\nShut the fuck up, Glen, you want to put yourself on the hit list too?\n\"You know, I mean a check! A check, Paul.\"\n\"I don't know, he's just a tough player. I don't want revenge.\"\n\"Right, no. Of course not.\" The older man fidgeted.\nWhat the hell is he talking about? Paul thought.\nThe conversation ended quickly after that, with Leroux tentatively agreeing to think about the offer. Pritchard had him sign some medical waivers that gave team doctors permission to re-evaluate his condition on a bi-weekly basis and administer treatment as needed. Nothing else even remotely unusual was said in the office of the general manager that day, and when Glen offered his hand, Paul took it. By the time he left, he had all but forgotten about Glen's possible wink when they'd been talking about Krieger.\nAn utterly disgusting mix of slush and rain had begun to fall, and the former elite prospect made soggy, elongated footprints as he shuffled through the parking lot to his car, wrapping his coat tighter against the cold."}

He'd go to the police in a second, they'd argued. You think an all-American hockey player wants to get involved in a contract killing, even if it is against the guy who ended his career? You don't want to compromise us that way, Mr. Pritchard, with him or anyone else. We would have to hurt you if you did that.\nHe frowned, cursing himself for letting that wink slip. But Leroux's eyes had held a certain dazed look, and he was fairly sure the kid had already forgotten about it. No way he'd figure out that something was afoot. He wondered what kind of meds they had him on, and concluded they were probably something strong.\nCome on Glenny, live a little. It's not every day that you get to hire a contract killer. Plus, the money this nets you is going to make all your gambling debts disappear. Now won't that be sweet?\nGlen supposed that it would be. He loved the thrill of placing a huge bet down at the track, but ordering a hit and then getting to watch it go down? Now that was on another level entirely. The mob was going to pay him big bucks for his role in the affair, and they'd ordered him to make sure Paul attended the rematch. Why let him miss out on the spectacle? they'd said. Give him a front row seat, let him see what happens to guys who cross the line. Ought to teach him now if we want to cut him into the business someday. Hell, it would probably give the kid some closure. The Russians had a strange sense of justice, he supposed, but with Paul going down - and the Falcons' playoff chances with him - some powerful men were about to lose some serious cash. Plus, they'd be protecting Leroux against further harm by providing him with an ironclad alibi, so that was sort of nice, in a way. Right?\nSure! Why the hell not.\nGlen rubbed his temples. He could feel a real bitch of a headache coming on. In the past, he had fostered a much more fatherly relationship with Paul, as well as most of the other players, and had still been passionate about the sport. But these days the only thing that mattered was the money. Not that Paul could have known, but some very powerful men had invested large sums in his future. The commissioner was in their back pocket, and if Leroux had somehow managed to lead the Falcons to a championship, heavily stacked odds would have made rich men of them all. Glen would finally be able to pay off that Bentley he'd decided to lease, and buy that gold locket for Chastity, the waitress from Chili's that he occasionally banged after work. She could fit both legs behind her head, and knew how to do things that his wife Barbara would have found obscene.\nAt any rate, now was the time to initiate Phase Two. Pritchard got up to lock the office door and then grabbed the handset off his personal line. He punched in the number of a professional killer by the name of Lars Eriksson.\nA low voice answered in a Scandinavian accent. The man on the other end spoke in measured tones.\n\"Eriksson.\"\n\"Yeah hi, it's me, Glen.\"\n\"This is a secure line, I trust?\"\n\"Yes, some men came and checked over everything three days ago, per instructions.\"\n\"Good. Then we can do business. I do not deal with men who fail to take appropriate ... cautionary measures.\"\n\"Sure, great. Look, er, Mr. Eriksson, let's get down to it, shall we? The money will be wired into the account you've provided at 8:00 p.m., half this evening and the remainder immediately upon completion. I was told you would find this arrangement agreeable.\"\n\"Certainly, my good man, I find it quite... agreeable.\" A sudden bray of unhinged laughter rattled through the earpiece and Pritchard had to jerk the phone away from his head.\nChrist, what a fucking loon, he thought.\n\"Agreeable indeed, sir! I think we have 'arrived at terms,' as they say!\"\n\"Then you'll have full payment by late Thursday. Assuming it all goes off without a hitch.\" He paused, then in a rush of bravado, decided to add. \"I don't think I need to tell you what happens if you fuck it up.\"\nOh God, why'd I have to say that. You think you're a tough guy now, Glen?\nEriksson burst out laughing again, sounding like a cross between a drugged-out dolphin and a late-80's Bond villain. Pritchard broke out everywhere in goosebumps. He hoped he'd never have cause to speak to this man again.\n\"If I fuck it up? That's a hoot! I would just worry about yourself, my good man. Your position is far more precarious. I hope you didn't let anything slip during your meeting with the young athlete today.\"\n\"Jesus, is that a threat? I didn't say a word. Get ahold of yourself, would you?\"\nNo sooner had he spoken these words than the line went dead. Glen stared at the phone in disbelief.\nWhat a crazy fucker, he thought. Let's pray he knows what he's doing.\nThe Russians had given him Eriksson's number two days earlier with instructions for the call. They had recommended him as a slightly unhinged-yet-reliable Swedish hitman who specialized in unusual or delicate cases. Word had it that he'd carried out over two-dozen executions of high-ranking businessmen in Scandinavia, Russia, and the Middle East. The only problem was that sometimes he got a little sloppy, leaving behind a key piece of evidence here, or blowing his cover and causing a bloodbath there. In spite of this, as well as his bizarre personal demeanor, many of the most powerful families considered him the best budget assassin on the market. He always seemed to get his man, and besides, they were on a time-crunch.\nWhen Eriksson had received the initial phone call and been informed of the exact nature of the job, he had barely been able to contain his excitement. Oh, he knew some of the other hitmen placed a high premium on maintaining a professional exterior at all times, and to some extent he agreed with them, but he hadn't been able to hold back on the phone with Pritchard. He hadn't been laughing at the old fool, merely expressing joy at the fact that he was getting a chance to take part in what would undoubtedly be a surreal and synapse-enhancing act of violence. Gunning down a hockey player in the middle of a game - what a delightful and unique experience that would be!\nHe would never expect an overfed pencil pusher like Glen Pritchard to understand. Eriksson found Pritchard's whole existence absurd, from the way he doted over those three worthless golf brats to the actual importance that he assigned to something as primitive and ridiculous as sports. Eriksson had been bored one night and decided to check up on Pritchard's family, even going so far as to rub one out to Pritchard's wife's Facebook photos. Incidentally, the demented Swede knew that he'd also be the one who would have to break Glen, Jr.'s legs if Pritchard breathed one word of this to the Leroux fellow (or anyone else, for that matter). Glen, Jr. was the GM's oldest son, and the head golf coach at Duke had reportedly taken a shine to him already. These were all facts that Eriksson had easily uncovered online.\nIn truth, a small part of him hoped that Glen would overlook something and botch the job. The Russians had a zero-tolerance policy for that kind of thing, and Eriksson would get the call to deal with the Pritchard family if things went sour. He'd be more than happy to play 'house' with the man's pretty little wife for a few hours or more.\nHe'd teach her a thing or two about attention to detail."}

He plopped down on his couch, cracked open a beer, and took a long, satisfying swallow. He tried to hush the nagging voices in his head. That conversation with Pritchard had left a bad taste in his mouth, as though the man had sold him out. The harder he thought about it though, for all he could tell, the only thing on the GM's mind had been getting him to the game tomorrow night, preferably in a suit and behind the bench. They could address the question of whether he'd ever play again in time, after he'd had a chance to heal. Paul wasn't as worried about that as he had been earlier.\nA new job. Krieger's return. Moral support for the team. It all seemed fairly credible on the surface.\nBut he winked at me. I know he did.\nAnd what had he been saying right at that moment? Leroux tried desperately\n(nothing we can do)\nto recall. But the more he grasped for it, the further it seemed to slip from his mind, until he wasn't sure if anything had been there in the first place.\nHe downed the last of his Magic Hat and pitched the dead soldier backwards, no-look, where it landed with a satisfying clatter in the recycling crate.\nNice shot.\nPaul supposed he'd better go upstairs and pick out a suit for his big coaching debut. The more he considered the prospect of actually going through with it, the more he thought it might work out okay. He couldn't control the fate that had befallen him, but Glen was right, maybe this was a big opportunity. Then again, he could already picture Krieger's triumphant return: how the hulking mass with #73 stitched on its back would skate out during warm-ups, that rabid-dog look on his face. He'd probably be in the starting lineup, too.\nHell, why not give him a big, fat contract extension?\nBut now that Paul had returned from the dead, there wasn't really anything left to do but carry on.\nGod damn if I know what it is, but something is up.\nGet to the game and you'll find out what's in store for you, kid, another voice said, this one strange-sounding. Don'tcha wanna get to the bottom of the big trick everyone's playing on you?\nLeroux supposed that he did, if there was one at all.\nThen get upstairs and pick out a fucking suit!\nPaul did as the voice told him.\n\n****"}

Huber-dome tonight for this exciting rematch between the Philadelphia Falcons, and the Portsmouth Stonecutters! I'm Jim Markowsky here with Brent Peters, and we're set to bring you some minor league hockey action. Let's go down to the ice for the opening draw.\"\n\"Puck about to drop, Jim, what do you expect to see from the Falcons here this evening?\" Brent said.\n\"A lot more offense and maybe a little extra spark. They'll be wanting payback for that devastating injury Paul Leroux sustained in the last go-round between these two teams. In fact, we've got great news for our viewers tonight, as Leroux is actually making his first appearance behind the bench for the Philadelphia Falcons as their newest assistant head coach! There he is now, looks great doesn't he?\"\n\"Gee, he sure does Jim, and now here come the players onto the ice!\"\nThe Falcons and Stonecutters streamed forth from their respective tunnels and onto the ice like soldiers storming a beachhead. A few of the guys batted loose pucks around the boards, but most concentrated on their skating; big, loping strides that worked the rhythm of the fresh sheet of ice into their legs.\nLeroux diligently observed everything from his post behind the bench. He'd felt alright to start the evening, but now he grimaced as a growing sense of unease began to work its way into his gut. He reflected that he probably shouldn't have wolfed down those two chimichangas right before driving to the arena. He loved the local delivery place, but it felt like the Mexican dinner might be getting ready to throw a fiesta in his slacks.\nHe closed his eyes and said a silent prayer for strength and dignity in his hour of need.\n\n****\n\nLars Eriksson unpacked his rifle with the utmost care. It had been all too easy to gain access to the wide-flow air ducts that overlooked the entire skating surface - just as his employers had specified.\nHe crawled the 50 feet or so through the ventilation shaft to get into position above one of the removable grilles. Gingerly unscrewing the bolts with his trusty Leatherman, he removed the detached piece and set it on its side. Eriksson now had a perfect white square of ice visible through the opening, decorated by an ant-sized group of players that darted to and fro.\nThe ventilation shaft hummed with the noise of the crowd as Eriksson affixed a long silencer to the rifle barrel. Lars considered himself a consummate professional, and required few (if any) instructions, but he had taken their point. Keep an eye on #73 and take the target out before the end of the second period. Then, exfiltrate.\nNo problem.\nWhy couldn't they have hired me to kill a goalie, he thought. That would have been much more relaxing.\nBut then again, he had never been one to back down from a challenge. Eriksson giggled to himself, and began to hum \"Sugar,\" by the Archies.\nIt was his killing song.\n\n****"}

Eriksson giggled to himself, and began to hum \"Sugar,\" by the Archies.\nIt was his killing song.\n\n****\n\n\"You okay, Paul? You look a little cheeky-peaky!\" Anatoly Karpov, the head coach, said in his trademark nonsensical way. Leroux had his arms wrapped around his midsection and had been shuffling around for most of the game, somewhat nauseated by all the back-and-forth activity. His mind was firmly located elsewhere; on his career, on his gurgling stomach... on the pervading sense that Pritchard had been hiding something majorly fucked up. He barely even registered Karpov's voice, but drew his head out of the clouds in time to answer without raising concern.\n\"Uh, fine, coach, just a bit distracted.\"\n\"Well, get your head in the game, sonny boy! I know you've had a pretty hard month,\" he confided, leaning in closer. \"But you haven't got to worry, Paul. I see this type thing all the time. Guy takes hit, chest opens up, you get my picture. But they always stitch him back together, ka-pow! The human is a resilient creature, okay?\"\nHe clapped him on the back and Paul had to clench his teeth once more against the pain. I wish he'd stop fucking doing that.\n\"Oy, shit, sorry Paul!\" he cried above the roar of the crowd. Krieger had just missed the net on a wrister from the point. The puck slammed off the glass and a group of forwards darted into the corner after it.\nWhat on earth am I going to do, Paul thought. He cast his eyes towards the rafters in despair. All he wanted to do was go home and get into bed.\nHis stomach reverberated with another brutal, liquid groan, and visions flitted through his mind of his picturesque bathroom at home, the very definition of comfort with its heated floors and well-stocked magazine rack. He doubted he could duck out at this point without Karpov noticing and making a fuss. The guys haff to see that you are here for them, he would say, one hand gripping the sleeve of Paul's blue blazer. At any rate, the period would soon come to an end.\nFive more minutes until that sweet, porcelain kiss of salvation, he thought, cold sweat glistening on his brow. He loosened his tie a bit more and tried to remain present for his teammates. That's the reason I'm here, isn't it? There can't be anything else going on. It's just not possible.\nOh, but there is, kid, that odd voice crept in again and said. Seen Pritchard lately? What do you think he's up to, huh?\nHe craned his neck around to try and catch a glimpse of the GM's private viewing box, which was located high above the masses and hard to make out from Paul's vantage point. Nonetheless, he thought he could feel the big boss's presence, gazing down upon his domain like some kind of minor league silver-haired god.\nPaul winced at a sudden twinge of pain in his chest, and had to relax his throat against a powerful clenching sensation. He gritted his teeth and massaged the area, where it felt like a hot gash had suddenly opened up under the stitches. In hindsight, it was somewhat ludicrous that he'd agreed to show up in the first place. He was in no shape for this.\nHe decided it was time to tell Karpov he'd had enough and was going home due to health. Leroux looked down the bench and saw the coach at the other end, excitedly describing some upcoming play to one of the other top forwards. Another quick glance at the scoreboard told him that under three minutes remained in the period. I can last that long. Come on, no sweat. You owe it to the guys.\nOne more hot wave of cramps rocked his stomach, and he knew he had no choice. He was not going to shit his pants on the bench. He made up his mind to leave and began to make his way towards Karpov.\n\n****"}

Two minutes left in the first period now, and the first 18 minutes had seemed like an eternity. He felt a certain pang of guilt for the part he'd played in the events that were about to unfold, but on the other hand, it was just so much damn fun. And what did he care, as long his family was safe? In all honesty, he couldn't wait to see what all the blood would look like when it splashed across the ice.\n\"Now here comes old Johnny Murphy up the right wing boards,\" Markowsky was saying from the massive flatscreen that Glen had had installed, right after Leroux had sparked the first real surge in ticket sales. \"He's got a full head of steam and - look out! - if it isn't big, bad Archie Krieger, swooping in to crunch Murphy against the glass! Oh, my, what a hit!\"\n\n****"}

Oh, my, what a hit!\"\n\n****\n\nEriksson continued to hum softly to himself as he watched the hit on Johnny Murphy through his scope.\n20 more minutes old boy, and then this has to end, he thought. He racked the bolt halfway back on his custom-made M40 rifle to check the round, then shoved it home with a calm and assured motion. He wound his hand through the leather gunsling and got a good stable, grip. Krieger was skating slowly past the Stonecutters' bench, though judging from the boos, the crowd had been hoping for a much bigger altercation. It occurred to Eriksson that he could just get it over with now. What difference would it make? The big #73 on the back of Krieger's jersey was right in his crosshairs.\nHe concentrated on his breathing and caressed the trigger, preparing to fire.\n\"Fuck it, it's freezing up here,\" he muttered.\nHe shifted his position ever so slightly, but he suddenly felt something in the vent come loose. Eriksson lifted his ass to see what it was, and that was when the metal bolt rolled out through the opening.\nLeroux kept moving down the bench towards Karpov, and lifted his eyes heavenward to check the clock one last time. In that same instant, he somehow caught a glimpse of a tiny, silver object as it tumbled through the air. He blinked, uncertain of what he was seeing; it appeared to be about the size of a large tooth. When it hit the ice, Paul could just make out a metallic plink.\nHigh above, Eriksson's outstretched fingers snatched nothing but air.\nFuck, not again! his mind screamed.\nHe peered frantically over the edge and watched the object fall to the ice, before rolling over onto his back and letting out a strangled cry of frustration.\n\"What kind of fucking amateur ARE you?!\" he howled into the empty shaft, not caring, knowing no one would hear him over the roar of the crowd.\nAnd so it was, as Eriksson was supposed to take the shot, that good old Dale Hansen decided to skate directly in front of Krieger at an accelerated clip, perhaps to take a retaliatory swing at his wrists for the hit on Murphy. Hansen's path coincided perfectly with the foreign object's resting place, and the tip of his skate blade braked hard on the metal piece.\nRight in front of Krieger.\nHansen tripped on the bolt and soared through the air like a goddamn albatross. Leroux thought he'd never seen such a majestic hockey flight in all his life. An obese photographer named Wayne Palomino managed to snap a picture of it through the glass that would later make him famous, given the events that followed. His image drew inevitable comparisons to the immortal shot of Bobby Orr.\nHansen absorbed the worst of the trip with his gloves held in front of his face, but he lay with his arms and legs sprawled out, apparently stunned. That was when Murphy began to make his way over, clearly intent on revenge for the perceived trip.\nMurphy wound up and delivered a vicious chop to Krieger's ankles as though he were trying to topple a redwood. The big galoot danced away from the blows, however, completely unfazed. In that same moment, a burly center named Mike Palmer from the Stonecutters charged in with his fists bare and took a wild, lunging swing at Murphy. The Falcon dodged it - he was just as big, but spry, like a well-fed antelope - and raised his stick with two hands, like a poleax. Leroux wondered if Mike Palmer was about to become the next Donald Brashear, but when Murphy went to swing, Palmer feinted ... straight into the open arms of Don Cleary, who ensnared him in a vicious embrace, and hauled him over backwards like a Florida gator-wrestler.\nThe refs charged over, blowing furiously on their whistles, but seemingly to no avail. One of the officials, Biff Kronstadt, who would one day blow a call that would cost a certain NHL team the Stanley Cup, wrapped Krieger in a bear hug as the mad German tried to get at Hansen. Hansen, the player that Krieger had 'tripped,' was just starting to peel himself off the ice, seemingly unsure as to what fate had befallen him, or where he even was, for that matter.\nHigh above, Eriksson had regained his wits and was desperately trying to draw a bead on #73. The ref's black helmet kept bobbing into his crosshairs, the hard plastic refracting the arc lights of the stadium in meaningless, distracting patterns. The killer's breathing remained erratic and he could no longer find his target in the fracas below.\nKrieger spun around in a furious tango with the referee, ducking left and right to try and slip free of Kronstadt's hearty grip. The thrum had grown as other players made themselves eligible for hefty fines by leaving the bench to join an incident already in progress, but the crowd around them bellowed like some singular, gargantuan beast, and hardly any of the players bothered to think long about the consequences. A wanton blood-thirst had rippled through every man, woman, and child in that arena like some fast-acting virus.\nLars Eriksson thought he might throw up right there in the airshaft. A wave of nausea had struck him, a combination of fear, rage, and frustration borne out of the realization that another set of plans had gone utterly to shit.\nThey'll string me up by my balls for this, he thought, feeling a bitter contempt for his employers. Why did he always end up working for such savages? The Estonians had been so much nicer; why couldn't he just work for them every time instead?\nThen again, how would the Russians ever figure out the role he'd played in the mayhem, unless...\nUnless the police find that bolt and the media figures out it was debris from the ceiling that made the guy trip. They'll put two and two together, and then I'll be dead meat at the hands of some Soviet butcher.\nFuck that. He'd complete his mission, in spite of the horrible, unprofessional circumstances. If Krieger wound up dead, who would care how the whole mess got started? He was a professional by God, and the ability to adapt to any crisis formed a crucial part of his creed - even if the crises were frequently of his own doing.\nHe readied the M40 and aimed through the opening.\nLooking through the scope, he grinned with delight as he discovered that Krieger had managed to slip away from the ref, and presented an easy target now that he had distanced himself a bit from the other scrums that were taking place.\nEriksson's breathing finally steadied. He hypnotized himself with the rhythm of his lungs, as he had on so many other occasions, right before he took the shot.\nWith Krieger's back firmly in his crosshairs, he drew in one last gasp, held it, and squeezed the trigger.\nWhat Eriksson had failed to notice, however, was the hulking form of Johnny Murphy skating full-speed towards Krieger. Cleary had taken care of Mike Palmer, and now that the referee was nursing a few good jabs of his own that he'd suffered, Murphy would finally make Krieger pay - truly pay - for the hit on Leroux.\nPaul saw everything that happened next with perfect clarity. Johnny Murphy's promising career ended that night with the same abruptness that Leroux's had. As he watched - a hair away from sprinting for the locker room toilets, amazing spectacle be damned - he knew in his bones it was a bad idea for Murphy to charge after Krieger. He didn't know how bad until about three seconds later.\nJohn Pasquale Murphy, who had grown up in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, working for his dad at the local lumber mill before demonstrating an unnatural propensity for wraparound goals and fighting, threw his battered fist at Archie Krieger like the bony, deadly weapon that it was. He swung with such force that Krieger, who would normally have absorbed such a blow as though it were a gentle summer breeze, saw the fury on Murphy's face and instinctively dodged away from the hit. That was when Eriksson took his shot.\nRight then, Murphy's hand exploded in a shower of gore, which splattered all over Krieger's face.\nThe action on the ice shuddered to a halt. Players looked around as the crowd grew silent. As their awe and confusion sank in, Murphy began to scream.\nIt didn't take long for widespread panic to take hold after that. Fathers scooped up children and shoved wives up steps as families and couples surged towards the exits. A pimply teenager with blue hair named Chip Clydesdale was trampled to death in the ensuing stampede, and it was only hours later, after the building was cleared, that medical crews were able to recover his mangled corpse.\nEriksson, meanwhile, grappled with his own onset of panic, although he thoroughly recognized the inherent danger of giving in to such a whim. Instead, he worked with hurried vigor to replace the vent, which now only had three screws left to hold it in place. He cursed himself a final time for his stupidity - now made a thousand times worse by the insane coincidence that had ruined his shot - and turned around to escape.\nHe went over the list of items he'd need to ensure a hasty, foolproof exit from the country so he could wait for the whole thing to blow over. The fake passports and disguises he had stashed at home would hold him until he got to the safehouse in Amsterdam, and then his agent Mikey Pescado would relay further instructions from there.\nIt's all just a matter of keeping your head, he thought.\nThe end of the airshaft loomed large before him. He scurried forward like a mangy, stray dog in a maze, and peeked out over the edge. It was a short distance to the catwalk below, no more than 12 feet, but he'd need to get himself turned around in order to make the drop safely.\nEriksson curled his body to get his feet pointed out in the right direction and inched backwards until they were dangling over the edge. He was now sticking out almost up to  his waist.\nThat was when he saw it.\nA monstrous rat, roughly the size of a healthy Labrador puppy, was staring at Eriksson with beady, yellow, bloodshot eyes. It was so close that he could see gobs of a custard-like yellow matter oozing from its eyelids. He could even smell its rancid, diseased rat-breath. Its fat sides puffed in and out as it surmised the invader in its lair.\nEriksson stared back, trying not to scream. The thing was enormous, and from the way it clicked its big buck teeth together, it looked like it hadn't had a decent meal in days.\nMoving ever so slowly, he started to reach for the six-inch combat knife that he wore on his belt. He gripped the sniper rifle in his right hand, but didn't dare turn the barrel to try and squeeze off a shot for fear that the thing would attack him before he had time to aim. No, it had to be the knife.\nHe almost had the blade in his grip now. He suddenly realized that, in his haste, he had left the rifle case behind in the shaft. He'd have to go back and retrieve it as soon as he dealt with this disgusting beast.\nOne of these days, all these mistakes are going to catch up with you, he thought. At last, his hand closed around the handle of the knife.\nThat was when it pounced.\nEriksson jerked backwards as the rodent flew towards him. He tried to stab forward at the same time, but in that instant he realized he'd underestimated how close he'd been to the edge of the shaft. The motion and the weight of his legs sticking out into thin air caused him to lose balance, and Eriksson began to slip backwards.\nIn a desperate attempt to regain control, he frantically wedged the rifle broadside in the small space of the vent and hung on to the stock for dear life. The knife clattered to the catwalk below.\nHe hung on helplessly as the rat landed on his face.\nEriksson began to scream.\nThe huge rodent immediately tore a long strip of flesh off his cheek with its razor-sharp teeth. In his horror and confusion, Eriksson convulsed once more and let go of the rifle, his arms flailing about his face. The huge rat was ripping out hunks of flesh from his cheeks and forehead. Then it took a nip at his right eyeball. It chewed at the morsels at a feverish pace, while its sticky claws scrabbled at his ears and hair for a better grip. As Eriksson fell, the long leather strap of the rifle slipped up his back and somehow formed a tight loop around his neck, just as his balance gave way completely with the demon rodent still latched on tight.\nThe M40 rifle held strong where he had wedged it as he fell through the air for a split second - and then the leather sling snapped his neck like a chicken bone, killing him instantly.\nAs the dead hitman hung there, his legs dangling just a few feet above the catwalk that would have led him to safety, the rat continued to feed.\nLeroux had taken cover behind the bench, and he watched the crowd draw away from him like some huge receding tide. He could scarcely remember ever being this terrified in his life. How foolish he had been to dismiss Pritchard's suspicious behavior! But how could he have guessed it would ever lead to something like this?\nEverything nice that Glen had ever done for him had been a lie. Paul felt his skin crawl with the knowledge. What kind of sick fuck would try to kill a guy who was just doing his job? I doubt Krieger even meant to hurt me.\nEverything swirled together in Paul's mind, making him feel like he'd just slammed three shots of liquor. To his dismay, he peered down and noticed a small crimson stain forming below his collar. The commotion had jostled some of his stitches loose, and a hot web of pain spread across his chest. He suddenly realized he couldn't feel his left arm at all.\nThe now-handless Murphy had collapsed to the ice while clutching his stump. His banshee-like screams continued to echo throughout the emptying arena. Blood spurted from the place where his right hand had been, and some extremely brave trainers were now wheeling a stretcher across the ice towards where he lay. One of them slid straight through the widening pool of Murphy's blood and went flying, legs up, and landed with a sickening crunch on his tailbone - right in the middle of the puddle. The young trainer sat up and looked around, stunned. The rest of the medics tried desperately to stanch Murphy's bleeding.\nArchie Krieger was nowhere to be found. It later came to light that he'd escaped without a scratch, along with everyone else on the two teams (with the exception of Johnny Murphy, of course). When it became obvious that a shot had been fired, every other skater had gone flooding through the open Zamboni doors, which a mindful rink attendant named Marty had managed to open before he himself fled into the night.\nAs the world spun around him, Paul tried one last time to peer over the boards and get a read on the situation. Then, something froze completely in his chest and he toppled backwards, landing with a thud on the skate-proof rubber flooring.\nPritchard, you son of a bitch, he just had time to think, and then the lights went out for good."}

It was almost midnight, and he had just endured a seemingly endless day of meetings with various members of his hastily assembled legal team. He knew it was only the beginning. Paul Leroux had suffered a mild heart attack, but they'd gotten him stable again in the hospital, and as soon as he recovered enough to talk, he would tell the cops whatever he thought he knew about Glen's involvement. Plus, Pritchard had absolutely no idea what had become of Eriksson, and found himself constantly looking over his shoulder. It was only a matter of days before the authorities took him into custody, at which point his life would officially be over.\nAs if it isn't already, he thought.\nHe got out of the car and headed for the house, but something stopped him dead in his tracks.\nThe front door was standing halfway open.\nA frigid winter breezed caused it to creak ever so slightly on its hinges, and Glen shivered and pulled his overcoat around his shoulders. Swallowing hard, he felt himself take one step forward, then another, and another. He watched as a hand that did not feel connected to his body reached out and pushed the door open wide enough for him to step inside.\n\"Hello, Glen. So glad you could join us,\" said a thick Russian accent from behind him. The front door slammed shut and the barrel of a pistol dug into the back of his head.\nPritchard let out a low moan as he processed what his eyes were seeing in the living room before him.\nHis wife and three sons had been gagged and bound to brown metal folding chairs, his wife in her blue nightie, the boys in their boxers. They were tied to the same chairs that he pulled out of the garage for his buddies when they got together for poker every other Wednesday night. The piercing stench of spilled gasoline struck his nostrils, and next to the couch Glen dimly registered a large, red plastic container, complete with yellow spout.\nThe muzzle of the gun pushed harder into his scalp. In the back of his mind he already knew that he was going to die, which was terrible enough, but to take his family with him? Christ, he had been such a goddamn fool. And now it was too late.\n\"Please,\" he was able to squeak out in a barely audible whisper, \"don't hurt my family.\"\nThe same voice as before said, \"I believe you were made well-aware of the consequences of failure in this endeavor, Mr. Pritchard. The price must be paid in full.\" It was right in his ear now. \"Normally we would have called Eriksson to carry out this unpleasant ... duty, but he seems to be, how you say, M.I.A.? Therefore we must attend to you personally, I'm afraid, Mr. Pritchard.\"\nAnother figure suddenly emerged from the shadows of the living room. He was wearing a black suit and a navy blue ski-mask. There was a shink sound as he lit the flame of a golden Zippo, then theatrically held it aloft in one gloved hand. Glen was close enough to see that his wife's eyes were wild with terror. Under Glen Jr.'s chair, a puddle of urine had formed. His sons, who had held such promise, now looked at their father with pleading, confused expressions.\n\"No, please!\" he tried to scream, but there was no air left in his lungs. In the living room, the dark figure stopped by each chair and methodically touched the flame to each of his sons. They went up with a hearty whump, until all three had become roaring human torches, still struggling frantically in their chairs.\nHis wife was last. Glen could hear her panicked, muffled screaming against the filthy rag that had been stuffed into her mouth, and the dark-suited man touch the flame to her shoulder. The last thing Glen saw was her nightgown erupting into flames, and the executioner stepping backwards so that he could watch the bonfire from a safe distance.\nI'm sorry, Paul, Glen thought. God, if you only knew how sorr-...\nThe man behind him pulled the trigger."}

We had crash-landed on this planet two days ago and the ship's distress beacon had been leaking out its stuttery little ping ever since, but I doubted anyone would hear it. We desperately needed to set one up much higher for there to be any hope of reaching someone. I came here with Professor John Werlinger, the ship's scientific expert, and me as the skipper. Call me Captain Wilson.\nWe also had a medical officer, Gus. He had sustained a severe head wound during our skid through the dense tract of fir trees, and had been slipping in and out of consciousness ever since, babbling about his mother and couldn't we please give her a call and let her know that everything was all right, we'd made it to Alton-7 just fine. Only, this wasn't Alton-7, and we had no idea where the hell we were.\n\"You should fix that pack Captain, your shoulders will be raw and bleeding by the time we find shelter if you insist on carrying it like that,\" Werlinger said with a fatherly grin.\nI was having trouble tightening my belt around the slick green poncho until Werlinger came over and hefted up my pack. He was a decent man with the kind of leadership qualities you might expect from someone who had made a career in the military - at least, based on the impressive set of accolades in his dossier - but in reality he had spent the past 20-odd years teaching biology at the University of Vermont.\nI, on the other hand, had focused most of my adult life on negotiating the bureaucracy of the United States Army, the futility and mindlessness of which had only just recently begun to dawn on me. I'd done two tours in Hong Kong, even managing to earn a Bronze Star for valor, along with a Purple Heart. A Mongolian insurgent had shot me directly in the buttocks, and I'd been unable to resist bellowing out \"something bit me!\" in reference to a classic movie. My guys thought it was hilarious, but I damn near bled out before the medics could get to me.\nAt any rate, somebody high up must have liked my style, because word came down from the top brass at the Foreign Planets Department that my next assignment would be a six-year peacekeeping mission to Alton-7. They'd promoted me to Captain, and the year was 2048. That, of course, was over three years ago, and I'd left on the voyage shortly thereafter.\nAnd now here was this biology professor, nearly 10 years my senior, helping me adjust a frame-pack like some incompetent boy scout, as opposed to a decorated officer with two silver bars on his uniform. He finished up and I felt better, though. I touched my sidearm, a navy blue 9mm Beretta, the way a college kid might tap the wallet in his back pocket before going out for a night on the town, just to make sure it was there. The gun felt heavy and comfortable on my hip.\nWerlinger clambered up a mossy boulder that obstructed our route, while I hung back to wait my turn. His wiry frame and lithe fingers belied his true age, and he hoisted himself up by grabbing the root of a tree, one of a billion other firs like it on this strange planet. I started forward while the Professor leaned against another big rock up above to catch his breath, but something stopped me. I peered about, looking into the silent depths that extended infinitely in every direction. I felt... eyes on me; whether one set or a thousand, I had no idea, but there was no denying that feeling.\nI perceived no movement in my wooded surroundings, but the silence unnerved me. I couldn't hear the slightest flapping of bird wings or chirp of a cricket, things I took for granted back home. The rain had finally stopped some 15 minutes earlier, which I decided to take as a sign that our luck was starting to change.\n\"What is it, Wilson? See something?\" asked Werlinger.\n\"Nah, just... felt like a goose walked over my grave.\"\nWerlinger smiled at the archaic expression.\n\"Won't be much farther now. Say, have you checked on Gus lately? Call me a worrywart, but I'd like to know if he's still alive.\"\n\"Er, I haven't checked in a little while, I'll call him now.\"\nI climbed to the top of the boulder to stand beside Werlinger and unshouldered my pack, removing the radio-headset and crouching in the pine needles while I attempted to shield the expensive equipment from the drizzle with my poncho sleeve. I turned a knob and watched the reception dial spring to life. The headset crackled in my ear as I slipped it on.\n\"Gus, come in Gus, you read me good buddy?\" I said.\nWe waited. Silence. I let another beat go by, then hailed him again.\n\"Gus, pick up the headset, we want to make sure you're all right.\"\nI listened intently, but could hear nothing save for a faint burst of static at the other end. We'd left him in the warm underbelly of our downed ship, the Argus, wrapped in space blankets that we had pulled from the bulkhead storage compartments, and I hoped he could still reach the damn phone.\nWhen he'd gotten hurt, Werlinger had tended to his facial fractures as best he could with gauze and antiseptic. Gus hadn't been coherent enough to instruct us himself, skilled medical professional though he was, but we were able to stop the bleeding at least. Humpty-dumpty smashed his face good and proper on the ship functions panel, and Captain Wilson and Professor Werlinger did their best to put him back together again. Too bad, considering he'd been a pretty handsome guy before that landing had obliterated his nose and cheekbones.\nTo my relief, a sharp clatter greeted my ears as Gus picked up the device and slipped it on.\n\"That you Captain?\" Gus said at last. A kind of sputtering fear had crept into his voice, something I could hear immediately in spite of the weak signal. That, and the injuries made it pretty hard for him to talk.\n\"I'm here Gus, we're moving up a mountain to try and gain a better signal for the transmitter. How are you holding up?\" I said.\n\"Wilson.. something... I don't...\" a blast of white noise interrupted his sentence.\n\"Gus? Are you there? What's that you're trying to say?\"\n\"Wilson... something... tapping... the hull.\"\nI looked at Werlinger, who paced anxiously a few feet away, kicking at detritus on the ground. He glanced back at me inquisitively and mouthed the word, What?\n I shook my head at him, a quick I-don't-know-hang-on look that people tend to use when they're on the line with someone who isn't making a lot of sense.\nGus piped up again: \"Cap, why didn't you take Werlinger along? You need to... work together. Now he's trying to get back in and I really can't move.\"\nChrist. \"Gus, listen to me. Werlinger is with me. I don't know what's making that sound, but sit tight and don't open the hatch under any circumstances. We will be back before dark, assuming there even is such a thing as night around here.\"\n\"Werlinger... with you?\" Gus managed through another belch of static. He emitted a choked hiccup.\n\"Yes. The Professor and I need to get up this mountain or we'll never get out of here. Do you read me? In the meantime, you are safe inside the ship. I promise.\"\n\"Safe... in the ship...\" Gus echoed dully.\n\"You just stay calm and try to sleep, maybe.\"\n\"Okay...\"\n\"I'll call again when we're on our way back. Keep the headset next to you Gus, and hang in there. Over and out.\"\nI clicked off the set and placed the headphones back in my pack, having managed to keep them fairly dry under my poncho.\n\"What was he on about?\" Werlinger asked.\n\"He said... he said there's something tapping on the hull. He thought it was you.\"\n\"Oh, my.\"\n\"I'm sure it's just a tree branch or something. Any idea what planet we might be on, Professor?\"\n\"Impossible to tell, sir. But I think we can assume it's inhabited. A vibrant ecosystem like this could support almost any type of creature, though I haven't the faintest idea whether it'd be intelligent.\" He paused, seemingly deep in thought. \"The density of this forest is a bit unsettling, I must say.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\nI stood up, hardly noticing the pack as I tried not to worry too much about what could be banging on the ship and upsetting poor old Gus, and Werlinger and I humped onward on the path that formed naturally up the mountainside. The way was littered with fallen logs, strange black boulders, and low-slung branches that were apt to swat you with a face full of needles if you weren't careful. You had to keep a close eye on your footing as well, unless you strongly desired a sprained ankle.\nWe shambled along for what could have been another hour, maybe two, barely exchanging a word, the air filled instead with the heavy sounds of our breathing. The pale light in the forest did not change, so far as my eyes could perceive, but I worried about the shifts that might take place on this planet without warning. We had been there for two Earth days and no darkness had fallen - yet. Must be a big planet, I thought. Enormous, really. And if one day is no shorter than 48 hours - there would have to be some sort of nightfall setting in soon. Wouldn't there?\nI looked up just in time to see a particularly gnarled root snag Werlinger by the ankle, and he barely avoided doing a full face-plant on the trail. He stopped to reach down, grimacing.\n\"You all right?\"\n\"I... yes, fine, I think.\" But judging by the limp he displayed following the misstep, I could see it felt off. Wonderful. Murphy's Law, I thought. Anything that can happen, will.\n\"Hold on, I think I have an Ace bandage in my pack,\" I said.\nI knelt down to open up the side flap that contained a few medical supplies and removed a roll of flesh-toned bandage. Werlinger begrudgingly shuffled over, favoring his twisted ankle and deigning to sit on a rock next to me. He began to untie his bootlaces.\nWerlinger brooded in silence while I wrapped his bare ankle. He slipped his sock and boot back on and stood up.\n\"Does it appear to be getting dark to you?\" he asked.\nI looked up. By God, it did. I had been distracted while tending to the Professor's ankle, but the cast of light in the forest had grown several shades dimmer in what must have been just the past few minutes. Rapid onset nightfall, I thought, just what I was afraid of.\nAs we kept walking, the trail began to take on a strangely funneled appearance. It was as though some huge body had slid along and burrowed out the bed of pine needles with its sheer weight and girth.\nI still couldn't believe how far we'd fallen, both literally and otherwise. COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE had flashed over and over on the monitors as Gus and I had wrestled desperately with the controls. Werlinger, untrained in piloting the spacecraft and therefore unable to help, had remained stoic, strapping on his safety harness as though simply awaiting the next twist of fate. We managed to stabilize the ship about three miles above the planet's surface, but the landing was anything but soft. Gus smashed his face when our starboard wing clipped a tree, but he'd remained conscious right up until we slid to a halt, a massive wreck plowing through the trees and leaving half of them on fire in our wake. Blood streamed down Gus's face like Carrie from that old movie, but he knew I wouldn't be able to keep the nose straight and avoid a catastrophic rollover on my own, and thus had held onto the yolk with the last of his strength. Gus was a hero for that, if nothing else. Now he was alone, tinges of panic no doubt beginning to gnaw at his senses.\nWerlinger hobbled a bit on his ankle, but didn't really seem too much worse for the wear. I trotted ahead to keep the pace, still feeling a bit anxious regarding the heebie-jeebies that had come over me a few minutes prior when I'd had the weird sense of being watched.\nThe path seemed to take us in an upward spiral around the mountain, which really wasn't more than a hill with ambition, judging from the topographic scans we'd studied back on the ship. I figured we'd be on the summit in another 20 minutes at this rate. The trees swayed all around us in the mild breeze. I cocked my head, unsure if I had heard something else - almost like the sound of something slipping through the pine needles, beating a silent trail towards me. I shivered for the second time in as many hours.\n\"Wilson, come quick, you've got to see this!\"\nI spun around to hurry back down the path to where the Professor stood, his face transfixed. He pointed to a branch that stuck out at a jagged angle from a rotten log that lay on the ground about two feet off the path. Draped over the branch was a large, bright green snake, its head raised up on a thick and sturdy neck, bobbing slightly in the air and staring at us with beady black eyes. A forked tongue flicked out of its mouth like a flame. Had I really just walked past that thing without noticing it?\n\"Guess this planet's populated after all, eh, Wilson?\" said Werlinger. For some goddamn reason, his voice was filled with delight.\nI shuddered. I wasn't exactly terrified of snakes, but I wasn't a huge fan, either.\n\"Big fellow, isn't he?\" Werlinger said.\n\"Certainly is an interesting specimen, Professor. I've never seen markings like that,\" I replied.\nWerlinger inched closer. The snake cocked its head and drew back a hair.\nWhat the hell is he thinking?\n\"Professor, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. Let's just get to the summit, set up the signal, and head back to the ship.\"\nNow, night had really started to set in - almost full dark, no stars. The reptile had a strange sheen to it in the thickening darkness, its scales glistening in the dying light like the fangs of a hungry wolf. Werlinger took another baby step.\n\"Nevermind, Wilson, used to handle these all the time as a boy!\"\n\"Professor, you're not seriously thinking about trying to grab that thing, are you?\" I asked, incredulous.\n\"Certainly... not,\" he mumbled. Somehow I wasn't convinced.\nI turned to continue on and hoped that the Professor would catch the hint. He had begun to irritate me. Three and a half years in a flying tin can with the same two people can do that to a partnership. That's what it started out as, anyway.\nBehind me, I heard a sharp hiss, followed by a scream. I whirled to see Professor Werlinger bucking up and down on the ground, the snake firmly clamped to his neck. His fingers scrabbled at his throat as he tried to pry open the adder's jaws, but it appeared to have sunk its teeth in to the proverbial hilt. I shouted in surprise and fear and drew my pistol, trying to line the iron sight up with its meaty midsection, but the man's desperate thrashing made it all but impossible to get a clean shot. I holstered the weapon and dashed to his side, got a good grip on the loathsome beast's tail, and yanked with all my might.\nTo my amazement, the thing came free, but it was far from a positive development. Two thin gouts of blood spurted from Werlinger's neck, and he twisted about on the forest floor in agony, his back arching so hard I thought it would break. As the snake let go of him, it snapped backwards like a green rubber band, jaw unhinged, teeth pointed directly out, and flying like some demonic arrow - straight at my face. I did the only thing my instincts let me, and sprang out of the way, trying to hurl it in another direction as I let go.\nThe alien viper crashed into the log we'd found it on and crumpled in a coil. I whipped out my Beretta and pumped two rounds directly into the shining pile of scales on the forest floor. The muscle-bound midsection exploded in a dark blossom like a flower filled with raw meat, and at last the beast lay mercifully limp. I turned and knelt beside Werlinger.\n\"Professor, can you hear me?!\" I cried, but as soon as the words left my lips, I knew that he had already joined the departed. There must have been some mighty powerful venom in that bite, I thought. The old Professor lay perfectly still. His eyes stared heavenward in glazed horror, and his skin had already taken on a yellowish, cheese-like hue. The worst part was his throat, though. The follicles of his beard stretched apart from the massive swelling, and the immediate bite area bulged out even farther out like a huge, luminous goiter. He no longer bled, either. I could barely tell in the darkness, but the stains looked black, not red. I tried to ease his eyes shut, but the lids were frozen rock-solid.\n\"Christ, Professor... I'm so sorry,\" I murmured.\nThere was no time to dwell. I was almost certainly still in mortal danger, and I alone now had to drag the beacon up to the summit, though I could no longer proceed without the aid of my headlamp. I grabbed the few minor components the Professor had been carrying and stuffed them into my pack, then switched on my light and spared one last glance at the body. It was a truly hideous corpse.\nAfter 15 more minutes at a brisk pace I found myself in a small clearing at the top of the mountain, but this too gave the impression that it had not exactly formed naturally. Something had intentionally arranged the area, like a giant nest. I ignored my intuition once more, too intent on setting up the equipment to worry about it for long. I popped out a tripod for the fabric dish, unfurling the latter and affixing it to the stand. To this I connected a tall box that bore a message of distress in millions of different frequencies, translated into just about every language known to man - yes, even Klingon, though they remained fictional in spite of our great advances in space travel. Hey, you never know. I flipped a switch and listened to the warming-up hum as the device came to life.\nThen, I heard a hiss.\nNo, it was a chorus of hisses.\nMy eyes snapped up to see dozens, no, hundreds of snakes caught in the beam of my headlamp, either dangling from the tree branches or wriggling across the ground, the motions of their raised heads expressing both curiosity and pure malice all in the same instant. I nearly managed to choke on my own tongue as I stumbled backwards, staring at the horde as they advanced. I would have already been dead, save for the fact that they all seemed to be in front of me, while the trailhead behind somehow remained clear.\nI backed off from the transmitter, my pack laying empty and abandoned beside it. The main thing is not to make sudden movements, I told myself. At least you've still got your weapon.\n\"Easy now, Wilson, they didn't make you a Captain just so you could lose your nerve and panic when things got dicey.\" I muttered.\nI held the pistol in my right hand, the blue barrel protruding slightly from my poncho sleeve. I was ready to unleash a desperate hail of lead at a moment's notice, but thinking logically, I knew only 15 rounds remained in my current clip, and with the extra extended magazine in my back pocket, that made just 31. There could have been a thousand snakes in the surrounding foliage, and those were just the ones I could see.\nI continued to move backwards and did not fire. Not yet. I had no idea what the sound would do. I couldn't remember if snakes hated noise or were attracted to it. At any rate, God only knew what these insane alien serpents were actually capable of, and they were definitely apt to get even more riled up if I gunned down a few of their buddies. Something told me the pop of my Beretta would intimidate them very little.\nThe beam of my headlamp swung dizzily across their gleaming bodies, and at last I turned my back to them and dashed for the clearing's exit. My thin beam bounced around the tree-covered mountainside, and in the back of my mind I knew the night could go on eternally. We had landed 50-odd hours before nightfall; that could have been the tail end of a day that in reality stretched on for a week.  I didn't want to think about it.\nNevertheless, my legs felt strong, and I had managed to keep my growing terror somewhat under control. What I didn't really know was how fast they could move, and how close above and beside me they might be in the full darkness. I did my best to avoid the low-hanging branches that hindered my route from time to time. My headlamp sent crazy shadows bounding ahead of me as I tried to control my breathing and negotiate the obstacles ahead without breaking my neck. Werlinger and I had made it from the ship to the mountain in under four hours. If I were as fit as I thought I was, and managed to maintain this pace going downhill, I'd be back in one.\nMy thoughts were interrupted by a dreadful surprise, as I had neglected to drag Werlinger's body to the side. His bloated green face suddenly grinned up at me out of the darkness under the powerful light of my torch, and I had to suppress a scream that got caught somewhere in my throat and then died. The thudding of my heart only seemed to triple. The venom had continued to warp his features, and his lips now stretched back from his teeth in a horrible caricature of a clown's painted grin. A vein somewhere high in my forehead was throbbing like I had just woken up from a bender.\nI stepped carefully around the corpse, trying not to look too closely, but nonetheless failing. His neck had swollen even more, until it looked like an overinflated water wing - those things kids used to wear on their arms when they were still learning how to swim. I tore my gaze away and kept moving. Something told me that Werlinger's death, along with the welcoming committee at the top of the mountain weren't the only surprises this night held in store.\nI had made it to that boulder where Werlinger had clambered up with such ease what felt like a year ago. Then the ankle twist, and he had begun to act more his age, as though the pagan serpent gods of this green world had thought him too prideful, and decided to bestow upon him a frustrating complication to put him back in check. The fact that he was actually gone had yet to fully sink in - it would dawn on me later, but all I felt was cold shock and a desperate will to survive.\nI pressed on. I knew the ship lay just ahead, at the end of the deep swath through the forest that our superheated cruiser had cut during the crash landing. I wondered if Gus would be conscious when I arrived, and worried with feverish dread about what I might find in the ship.\nThe path came to an end, and I wove between the few sparse trees that surrounded the Argus. The temperature felt like it had dropped 40 degrees, which didn't help matters in the slightest, and I shivered violently.\nMy headlamp cut a beam through the darkness to reveal the gleaming metal hull. In the pitch dark night, I found myself hard-pressed to negotiate the terrain around the ship as I reached for the hatch release. My light shone on the small window, and I caught a glimpse of my own face - bedraggled, sweaty, a week-old beard sprouting from my cheeks. I barely recognized myself. The eyes were those of a half-crazed soldier who had just been through combat for the very first time.\nI twisted the white metal handle and felt a pop as the inner mechanisms engaged. The door opened easily, and I slipped inside.\nI scanned the compartment and spotted Gus. The doctor lay curled on his side, his back to me. The makeshift cot we had arranged for him looked drenched with sweat, and I could see a slickness to the hair that covered the back of my companion's head - the part the white bandage didn't obscure, anyway.\n\"Gus?\" I said. It sounded hollow and empty in the confines of the hull, and my voice rattled around the ship's interior like a pinball.\nNo response.\n\"Gus? You okay, buddy? Something bad happened. We might just get out of here, but Werlinger...\" I broke off. He wasn't moving. I walked over and put my hand on his shoulder, then gasped at the clammy moisture that greeted my touch. I pulled him towards me, and his entire body remained stuck in a fetal position as I rolled him over, stiff as a frozen leg of lamb.\nWhen I saw his face, I did scream.\nThe expression was one of sheer terror, an even more grotesque (if possible) version of the grimace that I'd seen spread across Werlinger's lips. Gus's eyes stretched open to an absurd degree, reminding me of the protagonist from that ancient film, \"A Clockwork Orange.\" His mouth gaped in a silent howl of pain, the lips stretched back to reveal long white teeth. I wondered if it was possible for somebody to break their jaw by screaming that hard, but one look at him, and I decided it was.\nA slight clatter from the bow alerted me to a flickering movement near the nosecone. Before I even had a second to process the death of my second crewmate - leaving me utterly alone on this god-forsaken Planet of the Snakes - I saw the tail-end of one of those lime-green death adders disappear through a small circular instrument panel at the front of the ship. Perhaps a tree trunk had knocked off the nosecone during our landing and allowed the creatures access.\nA flicking on my wrist broke through my thoughts.\nI looked over and saw the tail of another one dangling through... the open hatch? It had dangled through just far enough to graze my wrist, thankfully with its tail, not its teeth. Perhaps in my eagerness to get inside the ship I had forgotten to seal up properly. But no, that was impossible! I had heard it close behind me - at least, I thought I had.\nIs it possible that those things are dexterous enough with their tails or bodies to open a door like that?\nUpon closer inspection, I realized the one whose tail had flicked me was not alive - I thanked God for that - but it had draped its plump body across the frame of the door, dying of a broken spine in the process, but nevertheless preventing the door from completely closing.\nSweet Jesus, it must have been seconds away from sinking its fangs into me when I came into the ship.\nIt was at that moment that I heard the hissing. Hundreds of grotesque whispers, all harmonizing together until it grew so loud I wondered if my sanity could bear it. They must have followed me, tracked me, somehow.\nTheir bodies began to thump against the outside of the door as they dropped from tree branches onto the ship, a near-constant stream. Worse still were the squeaking sounds as their bellies struggled for purchase on the slick metal exterior before plopping onto the forest floor below. I doubted that they would have any trouble climbing right back up the nearest tree to try again.\nIncredibly, something had started to open the hatch from the other side. In desperation, I reached up and grabbed the red interior handle and hauled downward with all my might, hoping to smash through the last of the gristle from the kamikaze snake and create a seal for good.\nIt wasn't working.\nThe snake must have been three times as thick as the regular ones, nearly the girth of an average anaconda back on earth. I suppressed my gag reflex and pulled harder, but bone and flesh refused to yield. The amazing and horrifying part was, not only was I unable to shut the hatch, but something on the other side had begun to pull back. The feeling of being watched had returned, magnified tenfold. I tilted my head back and gazed straight up.\nThrough the porthole, a terrible green eye stared back at me.\nIt was so large that it filled the circular pane of glass, and out of sheer surprise my grip loosened ever so slightly. The monster must have felt it, because the door jerked upward in response to the perceived lack of tension, like a marlin on the line that has sensed the fisherman's exhaustion. I almost lost it, but some shred of instinct allowed me to hold on a moment longer...\nAnd then, to my abject horror, the handle jerked free from my grip.\nThe gargantuan beast ripped the door from my hands with ease, the first tug apparently just to test my strength. I collapsed in a tangled heap of limbs in the recessed area below the door and stared up, dumbfounded, as a viper the size of a school bus reared up and tossed the door from its jaws to tumble away somewhere into the underbrush with a resounding crash.\nMy headlamp shone on the fangs that extended from its mouth, glistening and impossibly white. They must have measured at least four feet in length. I watched with morbid, paralyzed fascination as a drop of pure venom ballooned from the tip of its right tooth. When the droplet, now approximately the size of a softball, at last grew too heavy to stay suspended any longer, it plummeted through the air, sparkling as my light caught it for a split second - right before it splattered all over my left thigh.\nThe pain was immediate, and unlike anything I had ever felt in my life. I forgot all about my pistol as I howled in anguish. My new friend was already forcing its massive body through the opening he had created by tearing away the hatch, which had taken with it a good deal of wiring and reinforcement from the surrounding frame. Our eyes met as it lowered its enormous body through the hole, mouth wide open, tongue outstretched. I prayed that my death would be quick.\nSuddenly, my gun slid without warning from the holster under my poncho and clattered onto the aluminum floor below me. The hideous creature paused, as though startled by the noise. I knew if any hope of survival remained for me, now was my last chance.\nIn one sweeping motion, I threw back the poncho, reached down, and raised the pistol to fire, just as the bastard threw its head back to sink its teeth into my chest cavity and put me on an express train to the Great Beyond. I squeezed the trigger, and the hammer rolled back and snapped forward with reassuring dependability.\nThe round rocketed out from the barrel and straight into the roof of the massive serpent's mouth. The exit wound blew out its right eye, and a waterfall of black blood immediately cascaded down on me, hot as fresh bathwater, but not venomous or lethal - so far as I could tell in my shocked state.\nIronically, the thing began to thrash in the same state of abject panic that Werlinger had demonstrated just prior to his own untimely death. I assumed I had scored a direct hit, because these thrashings were beginning to cease even faster than Werlinger's had. It attempted to extricate itself from the damaged hull, but only succeeded in tearing a deep gash along the back of its neck on the jagged aluminum where it had torn the hatch apart.\nI lay back and shielded my face from the black splatters, thick as paint, waiting for the thing to die. Its head swung wildly back and forth, obliterating anything in its path but remaining mercifully high above my head, having not managed to forced its body quite far enough to reach me - though certainly far too close for comfort. At last, its energy seemed to abate, and it hung there just above my head, limp as a rag doll.\nI winced at the smoking scab on my upper thigh where the blob of venom had landed, but I was able to ignore the pain for the sake of crawling out from under those dangling jaws.\nI pulled back the slide on my pistol to check the round in the chamber, and touched the clip in my back pocket. Still there, and what's more, I was still breathing.\nNight had only just begun. In my heart, I knew that.\nSay hello to never, Wilson.\nI settled down with my back against the cot where Gus lay, and stared at the monster hanging down from the hatch-hole. I could hear the ropy thump of other vipers as they continued to fall from the trees, pressing against the sides of their mother's flesh to try and penetrate the strange metal creature that had invaded their world. Thankfully, the thing's body was so thick that they couldn't quite squeeze through - at least, for now. Maybe someone would hear my signal - I had set it up properly, and from that height there was sure to be some reception, but who know how long it would be before anyone heard the call. Plus, they could have already destroyed it. And if this planet were even classified, would anyone want to help, knowing full-well what lived here? Unlikely. But maybe. Maybe if I waited long enough. That was something I'd always been good at. Waiting. Patience. And barring that, I still had my gun.\nSomeone would come along.\nEventually."}

The sun breached the horizon of another day in the far-flung future of New York City, where everyone stepped out to begin their day wearing an identity-concealing facemask of the white porcelain variety. White jumpsuits completed the ensemble as the picture drew into some dizzy semblance of focus. The masses poured forth from the train doors in a sluggish shuffle-step up the tar and gum-blemished steps of the subway station, eyes scanning hungrily through narrow eyeslits for the most direct route to their transfer or exit. A man banged open the so-called emergency exit door to hasten his arrival into the sun-splattered streets. The citizens' minds remained blissfully unburdened by any trace of racial awareness one way or another. No one took their mask off during the day for any reason; they were allowed to come off only in the privacy of one's own home. Foam padding on the inside prevented the wearer from having to deal with any chafing or painful knocking while in public.\nStanding at the top of the steps of the subway station wearing a neat white fedora and matching silk scarf to complement his facepiece, Albert Pike casually checked his watch in order to reaffirm that he would not be late to work this fine morning. Albert's boss, Walter B. Frank, was often sullen on Tuesdays, which he would frequently claim to be his unlucky day, but Pike was sharper than most and knew how to please the old geezer, one of the ways indeed being punctuality. W. B. Frank certainly knew how to squeeze the maximum amount of productivity out of his white-clad employees, and he had familiarized himself with each member of his staff based on various characteristic details that described them. Generally he relied on eye color and context to tell his employees apart, but sometimes it came down to a certain style of dress. Like in Pike's case for instance. A white fedora constituted a common enough fashion statement for the pigmentless 2080s, but Pike's silk scarf was highly distinctive. He only wore it in the fall, though he would lovingly look forward to its smooth, gliding touch just as soon as that coolness came about in the air towards the end of August in New York. He loved that sense of change, of something big that could be just around the corner. It pervaded his mood and caused him to feel that it might just be what made each year worth passing through, simply that changing of the seasons. They weren't the same - the seasons - as the ones he'd read about on the neural network history sites, but at least they still changed. You could feel the temperature, at least, but tasting fresh air was no longer possible. The overall air quality in the year 2083 was so eye-wateringly miserable that the white masks had to be outfitted with miniature glass plates over the eye sockets, which lent the wearer a dazed, vaguely trapped look. The mouthpiece was a highly advanced piece of machinery that allowed the harmful chemicals to be parsed and destroyed immediately upon intake, thus protecting the citizen from long-term lung and heart complications. The Republic of New York had officially outlawed almost all forms of smoking in 2045 when the evangelical president of the USA arbitrarily decided that it was a sin and as such should be eliminated from society with all due force necessary. Pike wasn't born then, but his grandfather had shown him old photo albums where people held the strange white sticks in their mouths with looks of cool contentedness smeared all over their faces. His grandfather also told him stories of the old days in the subway, and seeing beautiful strangers, as he called them. When he would exit the train at his stop just as, for instance, a woman would board who had short brown hair styled in a neat bob and she herself was short and young and delicate and wearing a dress with a pattern that was alluring and his chest would swell while his heart melted at the sight of her and the grandfather made a mental note at the time not to ever forget the sweetness and charm of her unconcealed face. It was so cruel in those days, Grandpa said, because he already knew he'd never see her again, not in a millennium, and he'd take a reflexive puff from the empty clay pipe that he had kept out of habit and then pause to reflect some more. Nowadays, he explained, there was no such danger, no risk of heartache or loneliness, what with everyone's exterior homogenized to the point of pure and untarnished indistinguishability. At least, with the exception of a few minor characteristics that were of little concern to anyone. Who ever heard of falling in love with a person based on their height, anyway? Pike's world was blissfully free from such shackles, for which he thanked his lucky luminous orbs of plasma. If you wanted a partner, there was a massive waiting list to even be allowed to fill out a dating questionnaire, whereafter you might charm the faceless person on the other end into a brief, private meeting. After that there were contracts, discrete move-ins, and only then might you see your companion's true face, let alone get them naked. Or you could always buy an anatomically correct femme-bot or male equivalent. As a result, the country's population had declined sharply.\nPike opened the door to W.B. Frank's office and felt a brief wave of irritation gurgle in his stomach as the canvas legs of his jumpsuit grazed against each other (the sound always made his teeth shiver a little), carrying him forward over the threshold. Frank himself sat at his desk of polished fine Italian marble, head canted to one side. Pike approached calmly, though dark thoughts had already begun to swirl in his head, such as: what was the worst thing he could possibly do at this given moment? Walk up and pluck the cigar from his smug mouthpiece and put the ghastly thing out on his mask - or perhaps rip the mask off altogether? Violence was a seemingly constant refrain, and the impulses he felt had grown in strength and frequency in the past six months. The fact of the matter was, the plotters had tasked Pike with the murder of Frank, and today was the day he had agreed to commit the deed. Pike had his own set of qualms regarding the taking of another life, but he reminded himself of the obvious and the feelings rapidly began to dissipate: Walter Bertram Frank was the CEO and founder of Blanktank, Inc., the nefarious industrial tub manufacturer that had become the sole distributor and administrator of the Republic of New York's only form of punishment for a very specific crime, any fracture of the dreaded amendment, commonly referred to as the \"display rule,\" which had been written into the constitution of the Republic of New York. The company not only built the massive stainless steel vats, but also manufactured a highly toxic cocktail of bleach, paint, along with several other chemicals contained therein, including a solution of potassium that lead to rapid paralysis of the subject.\n\"We've got a tall order today, Pike.\" Frank began. \"An old woman who didn't realize her waistcoat was partially unbuttoned, a high school student who rolled up his sleeves in class as a woefully ill-conceived act of defiance, a young mother who was spotted breastfeeding in the Ramble...\" he raised his eyes to look at Albert with an air of exasperation and sighed. \"Do these people even care?\"\n*\t*\t*\nAlbert dialed in the code for his Park Slope brownstone, which cost him only $1000 NY a month thanks to the massive subsidies handed out to employees of Blanktank to keep them distracted from the horrific nature of their occupation. In fact, it was what attracted most people to the company in the first place. Donning his black silk pajamas so as to dispel the chalky aftertaste of his public garb (also a federally mandated directive for the yin-yang-like balancing act of mental health in the R.N.Y. - white in public and in the presence of others, but dark when alone; most people chose to live alone), he flopped down onto the sofa and blinked his eyes once to switch on the neural network, then twice in rapid succession to initiate a random scanning of recently released films that suited his mood and candor on that particular day. But something was wrong. He couldn't concentrate on any of the choices that flickered through the queue in the hologram before him. They were all comedic war films, a couple real ancient ones: something called \"Kelly's Heroes,\" primarily selected to appease the bubbles of rage that danced through his brain, teasing him relentlessly. The network couldn't read what was really eating him, however. He needed something different but found it impossible to articulate or conjure anything in his mind. Leaving the house wasn't an option. No one went out anymore. That old conflict had been phased out, the internal one where you would rather just hole up in your apartment, and yet you know you'll spiral into abject loneliness and feel like a miserable shut-in. The ministry had erased the guilt, using the ubiquitous propaganda posters and pamphlets to underscore the pointlessness of going out and socializing in a world where everyone wears the same thing; the authorities distributed wine tablets by the bundle, and the relaxation gas that was pumped through everyone's air filtration systems to induce a scientifically engineered state of bliss not unlike the effects of heroin made everyone content to ignore the social programming of their species. The white suits did away with all the petty inconveniences of true human feeling, freeing people to focus entirely on subservience to the State. New York had become an isolated hub of evangelism, sequestered from the rest of the world in order to create a society that, at least ostensibly, was puritanical, chaste and white in every way. As soon as thoughts of disgust and hatred entered Pike's mind regarding this current world order that he had the misfortune to exist in, a neural pathway triggered the release of the relaxation gas and in seconds he felt entirely at ease once again. A lost love that had never come to fruition disturbed him deeply from time to time. He yearned for a touch he had never felt, that of a woman for whom his love remained eternally unrequited. He was ashamed to ever reconcile those feelings either with himself or others, viewing the fact that he dwelt on it so often as an embarrassing admission of guilt. When the pangs struck his heart, wine tablets notwithstanding, he had trained himself to embrace the dull ache, and imagine a giant void into which is was only too sweet to descend. This technique proved surprisingly effective, though over time it appeared to lead to a decreased sensitivity to the jabs of emotion themselves. He found solace in the fact that they still hadn't managed to completely rob him of the sweet sting of bitter memory, and that afforded him a great deal more pleasure than the any tablets ever could.\n*\t*\t*\nThe punishment for removal of any part of one's public costume was cruel, but when the grinding cogs of the Republic's judiciary system decided to churn out one more human example employing the officially prescribed \"Blanktank method,\" everyone paid attention, and the powdered wig-wearing New York politicians achieved their desired effect. It happened somewhat rarely - the multiple infractions that Frank had announced upon Pike's arrival at the office was a bit of an aberration - and generally when it did there was either foul play or pure happenstance to blame. Pike did not necessarily disagree with the reasoning behind the technique. In fact, that had little to do with his motive for the murder of W.B. Frank. Pike's real interest lay in distinguishing himself. No one knew who anyone was anymore, literally; the white suits had wiped out every cultural blip that had anything to do with recognition, status, or notoriety. Such frivolous considerations simply no longer existed. Until now. He believed the act would give him those legendary 15 minutes of fame that his eyes had snapped up from the history books while reading about a man named Warhol and shoveled into his brain as a way to crush the loneliness that stubbornly persisted inside of him. For all he knew, he was the last person in the entire Republic who felt it still. Then one day a flyer, innocent enough on its own advertising various mask implants that were intended to alleviate the boredom of one's day-to-day but devious when opened to reveal the hidden note within, appeared under his door and suddenly changed his sorry state of affairs regarding the whole attainment of fame thing. Someone must have known that that was what he desired above all else. Checked up on his library records most likely. History books were of no great concern to the organs of state security, but this group had a very special person in mind, a citizen of the Republic who was perhaps a bit too wistful and longed for the past more than the average tablet-savvy prole that surged along with the crowd in and out of trains and taxis with little regard or attention paid to the surrounding environment. There is no argument that Albert's grandfather imparted this unique vigor from the pained stories of eye contact-love and included a certain emphasis on how fortunate they were to have missed that particular cruelty of mankind's upbringing. Pike disagreed, instead longing to be there, indulging in that inexplicable yearning to exist in any age other than one's own. When it became clear to his parents that some very peculiar thoughts were consistently popping into little Albert's head as a result of his grandfather's pedagogical leanings, the proper authorities were alerted and it was not long at all before the marshals arrived in their white helmets that were without any distinguishable lines or visual points of reference, and the dyed Kevlar vests (some technologies never go out of fashion) that had been reworked and updated over the years to protect the wearer against practically all possible projectiles up to and including photon bolts, as well as those melee-oriented criminal individuals that would crop up from time to time, their boldness commendable yet sorely ill-advised. They took him away and it was the last Albert ever saw of his grandfather, but the impressions remained and took hold of his imagination from that point onward until they became like a festering sore in his mind. A way to experience the past, to live life based on the rules of the time before his time. He thought of little else.\nAlbert removed the revolver from the drawer of a small end table that he had essentially converted into a tobacco altar some time ago. The plotters who had slipped him the note massaged his tender conscience with contraband delivered under the cover of darkness that he had never dreamed of seeing, items from the past that he could touch and experience. Cigarettes were one (though he almost never smoked - he treated them as a museum curator from the 20th century might have once treated Egyptian papyrus scrolls), and the gun was another; that was incidental to the mission, but held a symbolic value that was surely no mistake. He had wrapped the Colt pistol in a fold of buckskin that also formed a connection to the past, a tangible artifact that could no longer be obtained in any of the state-owned (and stringently regulated) merchants that lined the streets and avenues of Manhattan. Unfolding the cloth and cradling the piece in his hands like a newborn, his heartbeat accelerated and he felt faint, but he had long ago erased any trace of doubt. He went over the plan again in his mind like a tongue running over a canker sore:"}

He had wrapped the Colt pistol in a fold of buckskin that also formed a connection to the past, a tangible artifact that could no longer be obtained in any of the state-owned (and stringently regulated) merchants that lined the streets and avenues of Manhattan. Unfolding the cloth and cradling the piece in his hands like a newborn, his heartbeat accelerated and he felt faint, but he had long ago erased any trace of doubt. He went over the plan again in his mind like a tongue running over a canker sore:\n\nWalter wakes up in the morning and immediately makes a beeline for the upper left cabinet to crack open the jar of high-dosage caffeine pills, clicking one into the receptacle on the side of his all-purpose coffee mug, which begins brewing immediately as he scampers into the bathroom to adjust the temperature dials in his steam bath. While a circuit board stokes the artificial coals in the fireplace, he sips his coffee and wolfs down two scrambled egg bars along with an imitation sausage patty that came piping hot straight out of the carbon fiber packaging. Albert had memorized the schedule by heart after filing a discrete public records request for the file of (1) \"Morning Routine\" for Walter Bertram Frank under the general sector heading of H.a.Qu.P. (Habits and Quotidian Procedures), also known as Item #98430 in order to gauge the precise time that Walter would leave his 11th floor flat on the Upper West Side at\n9:47 A.M., aiming to get on the subway by 9:56, which he timed just so in order to guarantee plenty of room inside as well as a comfortable seat on the padded benches that lined the air-conditioned car. The train always showed up at the same time, and had just the right number of white-clad passengers - some hurriedly scanning newspaper feeds on their eyeglass inserts, others polishing their masks with tiny chamois cloths in the flinty reflection of the subway windows - to put Frank's staticky mind at ease while he felt the wheels rumble gently beneath him.\nHe arrives at the office with approximately seven minutes to spare before the rest of the employees filter in with their raise requests and constant complaints about the speed with which paychecks became fully accessible in their New York Republican bank accounts. Pike knew he would be reviewing various memos and faxes in his study (attached to the office and accessed through an ornately paneled oak door that swung open when one depressed an auction-purchased early edition of \"Grandfather's Chair\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne that stood on the shelf to one side) for at least the first thirty minutes of his morning. He usually played Strauss over the study's enhanced audio-delivery system at a somewhat excessive level, though dense construction materials and insulation in the Blanktank office building effectively muffled all sounds coming from within the chamber.

He slips in unnoticed and the game is afoot, as it were.\n\nPike felt only the very faintest pulse of Strauss emanating from the inner sanctum of Frank's workroom, the vibrations sending a quiet pulse up through his spine, which somehow readied him for the final act. His days of handing out summary sentences for mild exposures through the fascist white canvas garments of the Republic would soon end, and Pike would have his place cemented forever in the history books that he himself held so dear. There was little doubt that A.G.o.N.Y. would come, just as they had for his grandfather, and their beams would burst forth from the photon rifles attached to hips by retractable fiber wire for easy firing and subsequent holstering. This did not worry him in the least. He had long ago made his peace with dying, indeed fantasizing about his own death on a faily regular basis, though he had indeed made up his mind that nothing awaited him after he took his final breath other than an eternity of blackness. What a relief that would be after living his entire life in the Republic, the blinding whiteness of everyone's clothing completely overshadowing every other possible hue that might crop up in the city's landscape. He pressed in the copy of the old Hawthorne book on the shelf, just as he had done so many times before, and stepped inside.\n*\t*\t*\n\"Yes, Pike, what is it now?\" said the man at the desk, distractedly flicking his eyes up from the folder he was studying to identify his visitor by the Fedora and scarf he wore.\n\tPike said nothing. He stood there for a moment, tensing his muscles and flexing both hands, the palms of which had grown worryingly sweaty. He hoped that he would be able to hold the pebbled pistol grip properly when it came time to draw the weapon in a moment or two. After a few more beats of silence, underscored by the faint scrabbling of Walter's pen on a white legal pad, he looked up with annoyance, now providing the underling with his undivided attention.\n\t\"Well, son? I asked you something, what is it?\" Irritation bristled in his voice.\n\t\"Sir, I.. I wonder, when you were getting out of bed this morning, did you have any idea that you would die today?\"\n\tThe words, once pronounced, seemed to suck all air out of the room like some terrible vacuum. Walter grew pale behind the unchanging expression on his mask as blood thudded dully somewhere behind Pike's left eardrum.\n\t\"What is this, man, some kind of joke? I don't have time for this nonsense, we're well behind on our monthly conviction quotas, as you know, and furthermore...\"\n\tIn a rehearsed, fluid motion, Pike withdrew the revolver from its hiding spot in the back of his waistband and pointed it at the hapless C.E.O. of Blanktank. When Walter opened his mouth to speak again, his voice had taken on a glassy tone, as if ice water had suddenly replaced all the blood in his veins.\n\t\"Now see here Pike, I want you to listen very carefully. I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, but you're making a huge mistake. You're finished. Don't tell me why you've made this choice - I don't care. But know that the police are already on their way, and they will vaporize you on sight.\"\n\tPike had yet to expand on his previous statement.\n\t\"Your life is over, Walter, you're obsolete. I'm going to shoot you, and ruin your white suit, and people will know my name. Everything's going to change soon.\"\n\t\"It's your life that's over, son. The state exists and will continue to exist in spite of fools like you, fame-hungry and stupid. You think you're a revolutionary? You're just another violent individual who found a gun, no different from a great number of our ancestors in this city. You will be stamped out. The pure whiteness of this republic will prevai...\"\n\tPike squeezed the trigger. The gun erupted as a bullet crashed into his superior's shoulder, sending him spinning backwards and to his left. Scarlet splashed forth to stain the padded white canvas jacket that he wore, instantly spoiling the purity of the lack of color. He cried out in pain and shock and reached for a drawer in his desk with the uninjured arm. Pike fired again, this time missing the man's body but hitting his target - a large bottle of black Indian ink that had stood unused on the desk for as long as Pike could remember. It exploded, completely coating the man's porcelain face in a shower of blackness. Frank sputtered and continued to grope around for the drawer handle, presumably seeking a hidden weapon of some kind. At that moment Pike cocked his head to one side as he heard the unmistakable \"password accepted\" chirping of the outer door (Lena had presumably arrived) to the secretarial station and the seemingly distant clomp of heavy boots filing into the room. The oak door was now all that stood between the would-be assassin and a heavily armed squad of A.G.o.N.Y. He hastily propped a spare office chair under the handle to buy a little time, and smiled for a brief instant at the antiquity - and eternal effectiveness - of the old chair-under-the-doorknob trick. The policemen proceeded to unleash muffled shouts and pound on the door with gloved fists.\n\tHe turned back to his boss, who had abandoned his attempts to find the drawer and whatever weapon lay therein, instead choosing to wipe desperately at the ink and glass bottle fragments that had exploded directly in his face and were now seeping through his mask's eye-slits. Unfortunately for Frank, well-to-do individuals had the option of ordering a mask with custom-made retractable lenses and mouthguards, which could be activated with a small button under the chin that allowed the subject to breathe more comfortably when inside, and not at risk of exposure to the harmful air of the outdoor environment. Thus he had no protection against the dripping shrapnel that the bullet had blasted into his face.\n\t\"Pike.. what have you.. you're finished, you're dead, I'm going to bleach your entire family tree for this, you bastard..\" he snarled through black bubbles that were now forming around his mouthpiece.\n\tPike paused to think for a moment. There remained approximately thirty seconds, he estimated, during which he would presumably have to decide his entire fate once and for all. The man he had came to kill sat wounded and blind at the desk across from him, his clothing that had been snow-white that morning now drenched in black and red. He concluded that it was time to finish the job. He leveled the revolver at the man's stained visage, preparing to fire the final shot through Frank's stained porcelain forehead. At that moment, however, the repressive state apparatus that had received a discrete call several moments prior had at last succeeded in forcing open the door, practically tumbling over one another as they flooded into the room and took up positions around the gunman, who still held the revolver pointed at a person who hardly seemed human at all to those who had just arrived on the scene. And right at that moment, Walter did something that Pike could never have predicted - he unfastened the clasps on the back of his head, and without any further warning simply... removed his mask. With a rapid series of gun-clicks and white Kevlar vest-creaks, the authorities spun smartly on their heels to train their rifles on the unfortunate leader of Blanktank. He appeared to be totally unaware of what was happening. The apparent captain (as denoted by a patch on his shoulder) of the state-sponsored militia raised his voice authoritatively, speaking in a tone that suggested he knew the speech by heart.\n\t\"Citizen, by removing your facemask you are now in violation of Article 1 Section 6 of the constitution, which states that no individual may for any reason remove said item of apparel for any reason whatsoever, up to and including imminent death. I am afraid we must now place you under arrest for immediate re-sterilization processing.\" The words came out crackly and somewhat garbled through the radio-piece that was attached to the standard-issue police mask. Astoundingly, they seemed to have lost all interest in Pike, who remained standing in the middle of the room with a deadly weapon plainly visible in his right hand. He looked in bewilderment at the pasty, befreckled face that had replaced the clean white shield Frank had worn until a moment prior. There were smears of black ink around his eyes and mouth, lending him the appearance of a gothically inclined high school student from approximately the turn of the 21st century. Walter stared back in disbelief, not comprehending the situation that he now found himself in.\n\t\"You can't... you can't do this! Don't you understand? I run Blanktank! Without me, none of you would have jobs! I am the law in this country! I am the constitution!\"\n\tThey appeared to ignore his words entirely. While five of the armed officials held their rifles carefully aimed at him for fear of a sudden kamikaze-type last ditch effort to escape, the officer who had spoken first moved quickly and professionally forward to cuff the hapless individual. At first he shrank back in fear, standing up from his desk as he held up his hands palms-out in a pathetic attempt to prevent the inevitable. The towering brute had replaced his rifle in its over-shoulder holster and withdrawn a pair of handcuffs along with a spring-loaded baton, the latter of which he used to give the patient a sharp rap on the side of the knee. Walter Bertram Frank went down hard, trying to regain his balance by frantically reaching out for the bookshelf with his left arm, only to shriek in pain as a blinding wave of white heat shot through his injured shoulder.\n\t\"Someone get the mask,\" the captain commanded to no one in particular.\n\tThe blackened porcelain cover had landed intact on the floor near his desk, and a man who clearly had high hopes for his career with A.G.o.N.Y. scooped it up and forcibly affixed it to the guiding rails on the inside of Walter B. Frank's white hood. His eyes flitted back and forth under the ink-stained openings, giving off a distinctly grotesque appearance that caused several of the officers to turn away in disgust. With the cuffs finally on, Walter panted and groaned like an animal that had been wounded and subsequently surrounded during a hunt.\n\t\"Get him out of my sight.\"\n\tPike watched as the men marched out of the room in single-file, their prisoner at the head of the group with his head hanging down, a drop or two of still-wet ink cascading down to stain the carpet just beyond the threshold of what had formerly been his absurdly extravagant office. He looked down at the antique revolver in his hands, now alone in the room. He had utterly ceased to exist after Walter made the suicidal decision to take his mask off, in the presence of the last people in the world you would do such a thing in front of. He realized he was probably going to have to seek some new work now - Frank would presumably not be coming back to Blanktank, except for the express purpose of the dreaded re-sterilization procedure. He placed the revolver back in the waistband of his white canvas pants and, not knowing what else to do, exited the office and walked past a decidedly green Lena, whose fingers were clenched in a white-knuckled death grip around the tiny bag that contained her bagel-and-lox dietary supplement."}

He spent much of his time reading back issues of The New Yorker, methodically shelling pistachios, and rewatching his favorite Bing Crosby and Bob Hope movies. He never drank, preferring instead hand-rolled cigarettes as his only visible vice.\nEven after all these years, Crusoe still had nightmares from the war, and would often wake up drenched in a cold sweat.

He knew they were only dreams, but they exhausted him now more than ever.\nThe truth was, Arthur had been waiting around to die for a very long time, ever since Helen, his wife and soulmate for 37 years, had died in a car accident two years earlier.\nWhen he found out what awaited him on the other side, however, he realized that he probably could have waited a bit longer.\n\nHe drew his last breath in a stiff ICU bed, his three adult sons by his side. It was a long, tattered gasp of air through lungs that had long since turned black and ceased to function anywhere close to properly, ruined by the one habit he had given up trying to kick some 10 years back. Jimmy, the youngest, held his hand.\nThere was almost no perceptible delay (in his mind) before he entered the Second Consciousness. Instead of closing his eyes and slipping into a black, eternal sleep, it was as though he had simply blinked. Except, something quite different than the beeping hospital room greeted his senses on the other side of that blink.\nHe found himself standing in front of what appeared to be a small, brick schoolhouse. Its walls were half-collapsed and charred black by what must have been several bomb blasts in the immediate vicinity. As a certain familiarity with this time and place surfaced in some distant part of his brain, he suddenly noticed that he also happened to be holding a rifle.\nCrusoe looked down with mild surprise. Upon a brief closer inspection, he knew without a doubt that it was an American-made M1 Garand.\nOh, honey, he thought. If rifles were women, this one would be a sexy, buxom brunette that could go all night without quittin'.\nHe looked closer. The hands that held the rifle bore none of the wrinkles that he had grown so accustomed to in his previous life as an old man. On the contrary, they felt young, strong, and supple - full of life and ready for any task. He gazed down at his legs, which felt springy and muscular (unlike his old legs, whose joints had been ravaged by arthritis), and saw that they were clad in olive-drab fatigues. On his feet he wore government-issue combat boots, and his ankles were wrapped tightly in putties to keep out the mud.\nHe was back in the war, somewhere in Europe by the looks of it - that much was clear. It was a place he'd been before, too - some village in Belgium, possibly - but the why and how of where he'd landed eluded him completely. The magnitude of the fact that he'd apparently died moments earlier did not escape him, and he wondered if this was some sort of second chance. But perhaps in reality it was no more than a brief, hallucinatory interlude, and when it came to an end there would be only the eternal blackness he'd originally expected.\nBefore he had a chance to contemplate the situation further, a hail of bullets crashed into the wall of the schoolhouse in front of him. Years of training suddenly, inexplicably kicked in, and he ran, crouched and dodging in a zigzag pattern towards the entrance of the building where the shattered remnants of a door hung lopsidedly off to one side on leather hinges. He could hear a pair of voices shouting in rapid German maybe 50 feet behind him, and he dove behind a large desk at the front of the room, crawling into the knee-space and praying that the late-day shadows would be enough to throw his pursuers off the scent.\nNot three seconds later, jackboots stomped mightily across the wooden floorboards of the classroom. They stopped, perhaps to sum up their surroundings, and an order was given. Then they began searching again. Arthur Crusoe, who had once lied about his age to enlist in the \"Screaming Eagles\" 101st Airborne division to fight the Nazis, felt youthful adrenaline blasting through his veins. His heart was pounding so hard that he absurdly worried the men in the room would be able to hear it as well and find him immediately.\nSo what the hell am I supposed to do now?! he thought, eyes darting frantically like a hare caught in a wire-trap. His palms grew slippery with sweat as he gripped the rifle tighter. His instinct to survive felt strong, but engaging in combat seemed like an insane proposition. To kill others, or to risk his life (a life which, he thought gleefully, might actually have been preserved, or renewed somehow) felt like the worst possible option. The most violent thing he'd experienced in the past 40 years was pricking his thumb on a rosebush.\nBut the time was now. He had to decide.\nFuck it, he thought.\nWith a surge of energy, he overturned the desk using his broad, strapping back, swinging the rifle to point straight at the two men who had followed him into the room. His finger caressed the trigger in an all-too-familiar way, even though he hadn't fired a gun since 1945.\nThe soldiers spun toward him as he frantically tried to shoot, but to his horror, the weapon refused to fire.\nFucking thing is jammed!\nIt had to be a trick. An M1 would never jam, but the trigger refused to budge.\nEverything slowed down then, as if in a dream. All the colors began to swim together in broad brushstrokes, and Crusoe froze like a deer caught in a flood of headlights. He identified them as Sturmtruppen, for that was what they were - he could tell by the insignias on their uniforms, and you never forgot a thing like that. Crusoe felt his sanity slipping as he tried to process what he was seeing.\nInstead of humans, the soldiers looked like something out of his worst nightmare.\nCoarse, brown fur covered their warped and distended faces. Their noses and lips were black, glistening and rubbery like a large dog's, and they gnashed jagged teeth in their gaping mouths as though rabid. Steaming saliva dribbled down their chins as bright red tongues lapped at the air. They groaned and howled at the sudden appearance of their quarry, and they trained their submachine guns on him in a swift, matching movement. When they realized his gun was jammed, the unholy beings began to laugh. It was almost as if they were in on it: some sick, practical joke.\nOne reared back its shaggy head and let forth a bloodcurdling howl.\nThe rifle clattered heavily to the floor and Arthur clutched his ears, stumbling backwards. He crashed into the blackboard and cracked his head against the slate with enough force to send stars dancing across his field of vision. He slumped into a pile and looked up, utterly dazed.\nThe demons waddled towards him, grunting and smacking their mutilated lips with glee. They seemed to be communicating with each other, but in no human language that Crusoe had ever heard before. When they were speaking German... was that merely an illusion? he just had time to think. After all, it only seemed like they were talking to one another, mostly based on the hungry looks they traded back and forth. The language they spoke now had devolved completely into guttural grunts and half tones. He looked up again, and one was standing right over him.\nWith a vicious baseball-bat swing, it clubbed him with the butt of its MP-40, and all the everything went black."}

He looked up again, and one was standing right over him.\nWith a vicious baseball-bat swing, it clubbed him with the butt of its MP-40, and all the everything went black.\n\nHe awoke in a damp jail cell, surrounded on all sides by iron bars that had long since become coated with rust. His head pounded with a terrible pain that seemed to throb throughout his entire body, and his swollen throat begged desperately for a drink. More signs that I'm alive, at least, he thought dazedly, whatever that means. He reached up and gingerly touched an enormous egg that seemed to have magically sprouted from his forehead, and remembered the way the trooper had gripped his machine gun by the barrel before smashing him with it.\nThe thin sound of dripping water echoed in the shadowy corridor that lay beyond his cell, and Crusoe got up and walked over to the bars to try and get some bearing on his surroundings. He could see barely anything. He thought he was alone, but he couldn't be sure. Not until his eyes got a little more accustomed to the dark, anyway.\nThe cell was indescribably old, and stank of sweat and cigarette butts. Off in one corner was a mattress that was covered with what looked too much like bloodstains to be anything else. He paced from one side of his cage to the other, not really thinking about anything, just trying to will himself into a peaceful, more meditative state of mind. He soon managed to devote all his mind power to rational thinking, and he came to recognize that for better or worse, he was alive again, apparently reborn into some nightmarish parallel universe that could be Hell, but just as easily could be something else... something that I could escape from, he thought, a thin smile creasing his lips.\nHis mind wandered back to the surreal faces of the soldiers in German uniforms, how their jagged teeth had glistened in the hazy afternoon sunlight that penetrated the cracked walls of the abandoned schoolhouse. There was something terribly wrong with this place, he knew that now, and it extended beyond the fact that he himself shouldn't even exist anymore. And why had the soldiers been speaking German before, when they could only grunt and jabber when I confronted them face-to-face?\nHe prayed that there weren't more of those beings lurking around somewhere nearby, but he knew that was probably wishful thinking.\nThen, as if to confirm his fears, he sensed a nearby presence. A hissed whisper cut through the silence and the air near his cell, filling his veins with adrenaline. Divine relief washed over him as he realized the voice was speaking plain old English.\n\"They got you locked up, too?\" the voice said. \"Come closer, I can't see too good. The light down here is shit.\"\nCrusoe blinked hard, straining to see into the murky darkness. It seemed, yes, he could make out another set of bars in the haze, and he now realized that it was a row of freestanding cages, not built into the walls of a dank sewer like in those old medieval movies, but out in the middle - almost as if we're on display for easy inspection, he thought dazedly, now desperate to find out who the owner of that ghostly whisper might be.\n\"Someone there?\" he croaked uncertainly. His voice sounded wholly unrecognizable, and yet, impossibly, it was his own. He knew it was his own - it had come from his own mouth after all, he'd felt the vocal chords vibrate - but it wasn't a tone or pitch that his own lips had made since... well, since I was about 18 and trying to stay alive long enough to write my mom a letter from Normandy, he thought.\nArthur tried again: \"Do you have any idea where we are?\"\nThe occupant of the neighboring cell suddenly drew into the only source of light, a thin beam that projected down from some slit in the ceiling far above. Their cells were separated by about four feet of concrete floor. To Crusoe's great relief, the other man looked perfectly ordinary for the time, dressed in an American infantry uniform just like his. He had a young, boyish face that showed a few days worth of patchy beard around his chin and jawbones. The tunic he wore was somewhat ragged, as if he had been grabbed roughly and thrown around a half-dozen times - a couple fist-sized holes in the white undershirt revealed a hairless chest beneath. Relatively speaking, he did not look horrible.\n\"Could be anywhere. The last thing I remember was a battle, not far from Bastogne. I thought I'd be getting a free ride home on account of some shrapnel I took in my hip, but then lo and behold Jerry managed to sneak up on us while we was sleepin' in our foxholes. Took two of our guys on lookout and slit their throats right off the bat. I'm lucky that I didn't end up like Clancy. They cut his balls off and strung him up from a poplar... Or Hayweather - he had a mind that it'd be better to try and dart off into the bushes than go willingly with a bunch of savage Nazis, but this big kraut named Willy sees him getting ready to make a break from the line - musta sensed it, or seen some movement, far as I can figger - and that big bastard whipped out a Luger and shot him right in the back of the head. Poor soul dropped like a load a bricks. Never even had any idea.\" He rubbed his jaw vigorously. \"I mean can you imagine? One second you're looking for the best escape route through a Belgian forest and the next you're just gone. Hey, you got a smoke?\"\nHe wished he did. \"So you're saying, you were in a battle, and they captured you and brought you here? Did you see the faces of the Germans who took you prisoner?\"\n\"As a matter of fact... I didn't. They were all wearing gas masks, now that you mention it.\"\nA heavy metallic slam reverberated through the chamber, and a glint of fear flashed across the other man's face.\n\"Damn, that's our guards. How's your hand-to-hand combat?\"\nCrusoe shrugged. \"I'll do whatever it takes to survive.\"\n\"That's the spirit. I'm thinking we should give these bastards a run for their money, whaddya say?\"\nBootsteps rapped along the corridor as a pair of creatures made their way towards the prisoners' quarters. Only they weren't creatures; they looked like ordinary men - well, aside from the fact that they were - are - enemy combatants, Arthur thought wearily. The men stepped into view and he immediately recognized the death's head emblem on the lead officer's cap. Two grim-looking goons outfitted with gas masks and submachine guns flanked the SS trooper, whose face, Arthur could now see, was not marred by wild fur or dripping fangs, but was in fact quite handsome, clean-shaven and young, with high cheekbones. Their jackboots stamped smartly on the concrete surface of the corridor as they approached the prisoners.\n\"Name's Floyd, by the way,\" Arthur's companion hissed with a sidelong glance in his direction.\n\"Arthur,\" Crusoe whispered back.\nIn another instant the soldiers were upon them. The henchmen hung back while the officer stepped to the front of Floyd's cell, looking him over from head to toe as a wolf might size up a particularly meaty-looking sheep. Arthur couldn't quite believe his eyes. What had happened to the slobbering demons that had accosted him in the schoolhouse? Had it all been a terrifying hallucination? And who was this Floyd character, anyway? Arthur felt that he must hold some key to this insane puzzle, and he prayed that the Nazis would leave him alive long enough to find out what it was.\n\"Und vat do ve haff here?\" he intoned, in an almost-comical rendering of English. Although, despite the accent, he spoke quite well. \"Another couple of Amerikan svamprats fallen unto mein trap, ja?\" He grinned back at the two guards, as if this actually constituted a good joke. \"Mein Gott, vas it Hans who took you in? This old vet blanket? Ha ha ha! Gut vork, Hans.\" He turned and clapped the guard to his left on the shoulder. The henchman - if he were a man at all, under that gas mask - only stared blankly at Floyd. The expressionless black goggles reflected a flame as the officer suddenly produced a short German cigarette and torched the end with a golden lighter. A plume of smoke wafted through the air at his first drag. Arthur could tell his rank - Oberfuhrer - by the double oak leaves on his collar. A small shiver of disgust racked his spine - SS were the worst of the worst - but there was something fascinating about this man.\n\"I'll admit, I'm amased you haff survived the var up until zis point. Who ist your commanding officer, please?\"\nFloyd only stared sullenly at the German, who, while graced with a handsome visage, bore a strikingly protrudent gut that appeared to be putting some real strain on the buttons of his uniform.\n\"You can go straight to hell, cap. I ain't telling you scheisse.\"\nThe officer puffed contentedly on his short cigarette, now almost down to the filter. \"You are vun... tuff cookie, I sink ze expression ist, ja? No matter. You vill talk, vun vay or ze other.\" He slipped his right hand into one pocket of his trousers, and with catlike quickness withdrew a pearl-handled straight razor.\nRaising it to eye level, he flicked the blade open.\nFloyd flinched backwards at the sight of it, and a bulge of fear suddenly formed in Arthur's throat.\n\"You know, I shave every day vith zis exact razor. Vould you like to see how it vurks, mein friend?\"\nHe extended his arm through the bars of the cell, as Arthur watched his grin transform into a menacing sneer, and then pressed the blade firmly against Floyd's cheek. The American stood stock-still, his arms frozen at his side and his hands clenched into fists. Crusoe could see the young man's Adam's apple bob in the low light.\n\"Don't move ein muscle,\" the officer whispered, his face less than an inch from the bars. Arthur Crusoe, who until recently had been quite sure that nothing awaited him in the afterlife save for eternal darkness, could smell a hint of juniper on the officer's breath from the gin he had been drinking. Everything felt tenuously tied to reality, somehow, and yet Crusoe felt that this world was beginning to test the boundaries of his consciousness. His vision began to waver and he wondered how much longer he'd be able to hack it.\nFloyd, meanwhile, kept playing statue as the German officer traced a winding path along his cheek, which made Crusoe wince. The brooding Nazi dragged the straight razor down to Floyd's throat, where it came to rest just below his jugular. Arthur watched as beads of sweat broke out on his companion's forehead. The pressure was evident as tendons stood out on the officer's wrist.\n\"Stop it! You'll kill him!\" Crusoe cried. The Nazi's hand relaxed and the pressure lessened, but the razor never left Floyd's neck.\n\"Ah, so it speaks!\" he chirped, turning towards Crusoe. \"Maybe I'll just slice open zis man's throat and then ve'll see vat else you haff to say!\" The henchmen behind him chuckled at this, the laughter low and throaty. They held their MP-40's at the ready, fingers ominously tight on their triggers. Crusoe still remembered how loudly those guns had chattered in battle, countless rounds zipping over his head as he lay nestled in a snowy foxhole somewhere in Europe. It was something he hadn't thought about in decades, but the memory surfaced as easily as recalling his own name.\n\"You two know vat's going to happen, don't you?\" The sheer cheerfulness of this guy was starting to gnaw at Crusoe, and Floyd wasn't faring much better judging from the sweat that had formed on his brow. To the Americans' immense relief, the straight razor fell away from Floyd's throat, and the Oberfuhrer folded it up and tucked it back into his pocket. \"I'd be more zen happy to kill you both right now - I do luff a gut coup de grace, and you vouldn't belieff the pleasure I get from snuffing young Amerikaner, ven you slice open zeir zroats and zey bleed all over ze plaze like schweine.\"\n\"Just tell us what you want,\" Floyd said. Arthur watched the henchmen where they stood, flanking the officer, looking like some nightmarish gargoyles from the future with their guns and gas masks. Except these soldiers were from the past - his past, maybe - only it was rather obvious now that things here were not quite as he remembered them.\n\"You'll be finding out qvite soon. I must leaf you, I'm afraid, but Hans and Bino here will attend to you presently.\" He motioned to the guards, one of whom stepped forward and set about unlocking Floyd's door. The Oberfuhrer turned to leave, his boots stamping smartly on the floor like muted gunshots. Floyd had already begun to back away from his aggressor, who had unlocked the door and was now in the cage with him, grunting unintelligible commands through his gas mask and raising the barrel of his weapon menacingly. Floyd's hands were up, palms spread in a defensive gesture, and Crusoe shifted his gaze rapidly back and forth. The other henchman (Bino presumably) withdrew another key and began unlocking Crusoe's cell. Fear surged through his system like a toxic tidal wave, but he felt something else as well, and not for the first time in this place: instincts, and training.\nRight as the guard turned the key and slid the bolt back, Crusoe charged. He hit the cell door with all his might, channeling the full force of his bodyweight against the iron bars like a star offensive tackle. The masked guard was caught entirely by surprise as the heavy metal slammed into his face and solar plexus, a shattering blow that drove him backwards and expelled all the wind from his chest. He smacked into the far wall and slid down, apparently in a total daze.\nThe henchman who was still in Floyd's cell whirled around. He had been too focused on menacing his prisoner to see what was happening right behind him. Crusoe was amazed that he had actually managed to surprise Bino and stun him enough to get out of the cell and into the corridor, but they were far from being in the clear. The Nazi raised his weapon and squeezed the trigger, sending a deafening blast through the bars.\nBullets sparked and clanged off the iron, many of them zipping over Crusoe's head like hornets. Amazingly, none found their mark, but to his horror one of the rounds ricocheted and appeared to graze Floyd in the neck in almost the exact spot where the SS officer had held the straight razor a moment earlier.\nCrusoe dashed towards Bino, who remained slumped against the wall. He yanked up the MP-40 lying against the other man's chest with enough force to break the leather strap that held it. Barely conscious as it was, Bino's neck was wrenched violently by the motion, and he fell on his side like an effigy stuffed with straw. Crusoe spun towards Floyd and Hans.\nFloyd had fallen to his knees like a man in prayer. One hand clutched at the wound from which blood dribbled like a leaky faucet. Arthur knew they needed to get out of there fast, but they still had to deal with Hans, whose gun had apparently run out of bullets right as he was attempting to rattle off another barrage. Despite the blood, Floyd's wound did not appear fatal - not yet, anyway - and he was finally able to stagger back to his feet and step forward until he was standing right behind the guard. The bleeding began to taper off, and Floyd withdrew his hand from his throat. With cat-like ferocity, he leapt forward and laced his fingers around the henchman's throat and clenched as hard as he possibly could, though the blood from his hands created a slick surface that made it difficult to strangle his victim. The enemy reacted as anyone would, swiftly and violently, thrashing his arms behind him in an effort to break free. Floyd held firm though, his grip seeming to gain traction as the struggle went on.\nCrusoe pulled back the bolt on his newly acquired submachine gun.\nLocked and loaded.\nHe let the breach snap back and tried to draw a bead on the guard even as Floyd was squeezing the last gasps of air from his lungs. The Nazi's weapon dangled uselessly on its leather strap, while Floyd appeared only to squeeze his throat tighter. The guard's knees finally buckled, and a death rattle issued from his mouth, originating deep within his chest as the life shuddered out of him. The expressionless glass eyes of his mask glinted in the haze, hiding the man's face as he died - if he were a man at all of course.\nAs Floyd finally let go, the soldier collapsed to the floor like so much dead weight. The metal filter of his mask clattered against the cement as his face hit the floor.\n\"We have to move,\" Crusoe hissed, but Floyd only continued to stare down at the man he had just killed, panting, his hands balled into such tight fists that his knuckles had turned stark white.\n\"Grab his gun and let's get the hell out of here.\"\nThe insistence on action seemed to bring Floyd back, and he bent down to lift the leather strap over the corpse's head."}

At the top of the stairs stood a large iron door through which their tormentors must have emerged moments earlier. The officer was nowhere to be found, but God only knew what awaited them beyond the portal.\n\"Locked?\" Floyd asked.\n\"Maybe, I didn't hear anything when the other guy left. Only one way to find out.\"\nCrusoe reached for the large handle, using his other hand to keep the gun steady. The door began to open with little resistance, creaking under its own weight. Artificial light streamed in and a sharp, chemical smell struck his nostrils. What have we gotten ourselves into now, Crusoe thought, at the same time wondering whether he even cared anymore.\n\"So what do we do? Go out there guns blazing?\" Floyd asked.\n\"No... that can't possibly work,\" Arthur said. He was reminded of an old film where the main characters had found themselves surrounded by federales, with about a thousand rifles trained on the door of the shack where they'd decided to make their last stand. The movie ended as they burst through the door with their revolvers drawn, the heroes resigned to die in a glorious hail of gunfire. Crusoe sort of liked the idea of going out like that, but he wasn't quite ready to give up the ghost just yet.\nThen again, do we have any other choice?\n\"I think we have to go through, either way,\" Crusoe said. \"But maybe we can take a more... strategic approach.\"\n\"All right, I'm with you. But I'm feeling faint, cap. Feels like about 50 killer bees went to work on one single spot on my neck, an' I can't tell how much blood I've lost.\" He yanked at his collar to show Crusoe. \"Can you tell if it's bad?\"\nThe man who should have been sleeping peacefully in his grave for about 6 hours by now held the door to keep it from opening for just a bit longer; he could stand to delay their fate for another scant few seconds.\nHe raised his eyes to peer at the wound. In point of fact, it was little more than a deep scratch, but Crusoe could easily imagine the pain his companion had to be experiencing. The bleeding had stopped, leaving only large, tacky stains caked all over his neck like parched earth.\n\"Floyd - do you have any idea what's going on here?\"\nHe winced and drew back from the door, as though some invisible force were repelling him - or, to be more precise, as if he already knew something horrible lay on the other side. To Arthur, it was as though the other man was retreating from the very suggestion that he might have some inside knowledge of his own.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Look, I know we haven't exactly had much time to get to know each other, but there's something I haven't exactly been forthcoming with you about.\"\nFloyd eyed him suspiciously. \"How so?\"\n\"I don't exactly know how much time has passed, but... well...\" He struggled to find the words. He looked at his new comrade, who wore a strained, desperate expression, full of smoldering anger and confusion at their predicament.\n\"Come on, man, spill it!\"\n\"The thing is, Floyd... the last thing I remember, before coming here, is that I was surrounded by my family at the hospital... and, well, I died. That's what happened. I closed my eyes and took a breath that felt momentous somehow... and then I passed away. Only, next thing I knew, I was in some Belgian schoolhouse and I had a rifle in my hands... and I was young again, don't you see? If I'm dead, then what does that make you?\"\nFloyd's hands dropped to his side and the automatic fell against his brass belt buckle. Sure enough, he looked like he'd just seen a ghost.\n\"That can't be... I survived... there was a firefight, a battle on a river, a week before Bastogne.\" He swallowed hard, and Crusoe waited patiently for him to go on. \"I remember... a bridge. We were supposed to guard it, but we knew they'd be advancing with heavy armor. Tigers, Panthers, the whole fucking works.\" The words continued to flow, his memory seeming to solidify with every breath.\n\"I landed a support gig and was packing a BAR that day - thing is so fucking heavy, but it sure feels light when you lick off a half-dozen rounds right into the chest of some charging kraut - and we'd stacked up five guys deep right on the berm. Perfect line of sight, beautiful day. Like you wouldn't believe.\"\n\"I can imagine,\" Crusoe said gently. \"Go on.\"\n\"So I'm lying there on my belly, gravel and dust all down the front of my shirt, when suddenly this kid in a German uniform steps out onto the main street, about 100 yards away. He looked maybe 20 at most. He was holding his Karabiner in one hand like a damn peasant boy out on a hunting trip. One of the guys on my right yells 'contact!' and that's when the fireworks started. The poor bastard caught about 30 rounds in the face and upper chest and blew over like a sapling in a hurricane. I got off a few good bursts, not sure if any of them found their target...\" He avoided Crusoe's gaze, as though ashamed of his own participation.\n\"What happened next?\"\n\"Well, that kid turned out to be a decoy, or scout, or some damned thing. He got killed and then a whole wall of fire opened up from just about every possible window and hidey-hole on the other side of the river, across the bridge from us. I caught a rock fragment in my eye from a ricochet right in front of me.\" He rubbed his temples and for the first time Crusoe noticed the milky waste that was Floyd's right eye.\nHow had I missed that before?\n\"The pain was terrible. I ran back towards a blown-out store on our side of the river bank - I think it might have been a deli, with one of those big glass cases off to the side, but everything was blasted all to hell from the shellings - and I couldn't see a fucking thing... but I ran for the stairs anyway, just to try and find some cover, get out of the fight for a second, you know?\"\n\"Sure, Floyd, I know.\"\n\"I ran up the stairs, and there was a door at the top. I remember thinking that maybe it led to a nice apartment, and maybe there'd be some beautiful dame in there that would take me in and save me, and I'd be safe for a while.\"\n\"Tell me what happened when you opened that door.\"\n\"I... I climbed up the last few steps and I busted it open with the butt of my BAR. The doorframe was cheap French siding that wouldn't withstand a stiff breeze, and I basically crashed through the thing and stumbled into the living room...\"\nHe watched as Floyd's hands inched towards the bottom of his shirt. He barely seemed to realize he was doing it.\nIt was then that Arthur noticed a huge maroon stain smeared across the belly of the undershirt.\n\"The biggest goddamn kraut you ever saw in your life was just... standing there, right in the kitchen with a Luger in one hand and a big old meat cleaver in the other. He was grinding his teeth - I remember that sound, like... like somebody trying to crush gravel between two pieces of sandpaper. We stared at each other across that expanse of room and what felt like an eternity went by before he just rushed me.\"\nHe lifted his shirt to reveal a gaping stomach wound. Shiny coils of intestine were visible through a few ragged strings of flesh that were barely keeping them from spilling out. Other, shallower hack-marks decorated the surrounding area like scribbled lines of ink. Crusoe choked off a scream that very nearly burst from his throat at the sight of it. Floyd hardly seemed to notice.\n\"He got me pretty good I guess, but I popped off at least a couple rounds before he fell on top of me, whaling on my head with the pistol and hacking away at my insides like some crazy savage. Christ, I'd all but forgotten!\"\n\"Where do you think we are now?\"\n\"If we're dead? Christ, well, this can't be Heaven, and I'd say that kind of narrows it down, don't you think?\"\nCrusoe scratched his head. \"But what did we ever do to wind up here?\" he asked. \"I led a good life, worked hard, gave my wife all the love I had to give, raised some great kids. If God was upset at me for something, he sure never hinted at it while I was alive.\"\n\"And all I ever did was get gutted like a trout for serving my country. Some kind of reward this is, jailed and tortured by fascist lunatics, living out some sick nightmare. Christ almighty.\"\n\"Floyd, I think we have to see what's on the other side of this door now,\" Arthur said in a steady voice. The crack of light that was already visible bade them forward like some sort of magnetic field. \"At least we know they can be killed. Our actions must have meaning here, they must. Can I count on you, brother?\"\nFloyd nodded.\n\"Good. Now ready that weapon and stay low, behind me.\""}

Some kind of reward this is, jailed and tortured by fascist lunatics, living out some sick nightmare. Christ almighty.\"\n\"Floyd, I think we have to see what's on the other side of this door now,\" Arthur said in a steady voice. The crack of light that was already visible bade them forward like some sort of magnetic field. \"At least we know they can be killed. Our actions must have meaning here, they must. Can I count on you, brother?\"\nFloyd nodded.\n\"Good. Now ready that weapon and stay low, behind me.\"\n\nThey were all waiting for them, of course.\nBeyond the door lay the type of room that one might associate with high-profile surgeries or autopsies. A large rectangular table stood in the middle of a circular space. The walls of this enclosure stretched up to a windowed observation deck, where the Oberfuhrer they'd met before sat amongst his various cronies. The officers were smoking, talking, laughing, sharing jokes whose grotesque punchlines one could scarcely imagine. They had been expecting Hans and Bino to emerge through that door with the prisoners in tow, ready for a certain ritual that would soon follow.\nThe table in the room was adorned with two sets of leather restraints, clearly equipped to handle two people at once. Crusoe, meanwhile, laid his palm flat against the other side of the door, gently expanding the crack of light until it grew to a crevasse, larger and larger until the room's bright blue walls drew into sight. He held his machine gun at the ready with one hand, his arm wound tightly through the broken leather strap to help him aim. Taking one last gulp of chemical-tasting air, he shoved the door wide open, hanging back just out of view to at least preserve some modicum of cover. Floyd mimicked his position, staying close by Arthur's side.\nThe iron hinges creaked loudly, catching the attention of the ghoulish crew of SS officers who had remained oblivious until that moment. They trained their eyes on the door as it flung outward, twin submachine gun barrels protruding grimly from the hazy space at the top of the dungeon steps. In the gloom, Crusoe and Floyd both looked like dogs that had been left to die in some alleyway.\nThe Oberfuhrer, whose name in a previous life had been Kleiner, and who used to like nothing better than a warm glass of schnapps while he watched the Austrian sunset with Mr. Richard Wagner on the record player, had left for the front in 1941. There, he would eventually catch a British sniper's bullet directly in the groin. In this realm, Floyd and Crusoe had both failed to notice the tiny red rose that bloomed on his lap, but it perfectly matched the flush in his cheeks now as he howled and screamed for his comrades to secure the renegade prisoners.\nCrusoe aimed at Kleiner through the glass, and squeezed the trigger. Hot fire flashed from the muzzle, and the glass shattered in the same instant, burying the observation party in a hail of razor-like shards.\nFloyd barreled out towards the middle of the room and took cover behind the operating table. His hands were slick with sweat, and it took him another second to get a firm grip on his own gun. The roar of Crusoe's barrage shattered the air on the other side of the room, and Floyd flinched. He felt an urge to cry out, but he held onto his wits and instead focused on staying hidden below the wide table. It seemed like no one was paying attention to him. In fact, it felt like no one had even detected his presence at all. His buddy Crusoe continued to let off bursts from the door, lashing out from the shadows like a venomous spider.\nKleiner had apparently been hit by one of these barrages, and Floyd was fairly certain that he'd seen the officer catch at least a few rounds in the upper midsection. He considered leaning out to try and see more, but resisted that urge as well. He briefly reflected on the irony of trying to stay alive when he had already had his guts carved up quite thoroughly, thank you very much, but he doubted at this point whether the situation could possibly get any worse. Nevertheless, a dire sense of survival had taken hold in both men now, and that was enough to drive them onward. For if that instinct still remained, wasn't that a sign that there might still be something worth fighting for?\nThey heard more shouting as the officers upstairs tried to rally while Crusoe reloaded. He had already gunned down Kleiner - so it seemed - but he had seen at least three or four other high-ranking SS rats in the room before the glass shattered and everyone dropped from sight. A shiver racked his spine as he tried not to think about what they had planned to do to them in this room.\nHe crooked his wrists and blind-fired the MP-40 from the edge of the doorway, managing to shear off a few more jagged chunks of glass from the windows. He had absolutely no idea how he and Floyd had made it this far, and at this point escape seemed to be a lost cause. But still they had to fight.\nSeveral Luger rounds pounded the area around the doorway, a few almost finding their way to Crusoe.\n\"Look around the room, can you see any possible way out?\" he yelled over towards the table.\nFloyd peered around his cover and scanned the room. To his amazement, he spied a small door that he hadn't been able to see at first from the other side. He found his voice: \"Holy shit. I see another door!\"\nCrusoe felt a bubble of hope rise within his chest. Maybe there was some chance of escape after all. The danger he'd experienced in this place, however, seemed strongly to dictate that they could easily die again, and he had no desire to find out what other dastardly levels of insanity might await him beyond this world. But then again, maybe something far worse than death lay in store. The door could be their way to avoid that fate.\nRegardless, there was nothing that mitigated the will to live he felt in the present moment. But what of his comrade? That brave young man named Floyd whom he had probably met at some time or another during the real war, when he'd truly been alive, needed his help. He aimed to give it to him.\nHe peeked around the edge of the door and actually managed to catch a glimpse of his ghostly companion, glued to the edge of the operating table like it was the last bulwark of humanity. General growls and curses echoed from the upper levels, but the sporadic small-arms fire seemed to have died down for the time being.\n\"Floyd, you all right?\" Crusoe called out. \"I think you should cover me and I'll make a run for it, how about it?\"\n\"Ready when you are, cap!\"\nHe had a feeling there were more perfectly able-bodied SS officers crouched in wait in the upper deck, just waiting for the chance to spring up and shred them both with a volley of pistol rounds, but he also knew in his heart that time was running out. He reared up from behind the table and flung his MP-40 into a firing position. He sprayed a dozen bullets at the upper windows with a single burst, and that was when Crusoe seized his own chance.\nHe darted out from his spot behind the door and licked off six or seven gobs of hot lead while sprinting towards the small portal in the far wall. It almost looks like the front door of Bag End, he thought.\nA scream burst forth from the upper floor: \"DO NOT LET ZEM GET TO ZE EXIT.\" It was Kleiner, alive and well. But Arthur was already at the door, fumbling with the antique iron handle that adorned it. He yanked hard - once, twice - but before he could get it to open he felt a sting in the back of his neck, followed by blinding pain. More gunshots erupted from above and below, and he reached back in a daze to find a steady stream of blood flowing from the wound.\n\"Floyd,\" he moaned, \"Floyd, help me...\"\nHe turned slightly, then hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. Floyd, meanwhile, had managed to scoop an extra ammo clip up off the floor and was reloading his weapon. He glanced over and saw that Crusoe was in severely dire straits, as he was now convulsing on the floor like a trout on a riverbank. A gunshot wound bled profusely from the back of his neck. Floyd hadn't seen the shooter, but he'd heard the voice that preceded it. He scanned the upper level, hoping that some hint of movement would reveal the enemy's position, but to no avail.\n\"Arthur?!\" he cried.\nCrusoe didn't answer, only kicking his legs and smacking his lips with a wet, sloppy sound. What the hell was happening to him? Floyd thought feverishly. He kept one eye on Crusoe while concentrating his ears on the observation deck to try and get the jump on who - or what - ever might still be up there.\nThat was when he heard a slight patter - more of a scraping sound, really - resonate along one of the upper walls. Whatever was making that noise remained just out of sight below the shattered window bay. It almost seemed to be in the spot where Kleiner might have taken cover from Crusoe's repeated volleys.\nIt can't be him, Floyd thought. If we were able to kill those guards with our bare hands, how could an officer survive so many gunshot wounds? He was certain Crusoe had shot him, but even then he knew the answer to his own question, or at least one possible theory: the officers might possess some quality that the lower henchmen did not. Their weapons might, too. He'd been grazed, sure, but by an MP-40. Did the pistols that the officers carried contain some horrible chemical bullets that the submachine guns did not?\nEither way, Crusoe appeared to be going completely insane.\nIn addition to the scraping noise, Floyd could now make out what sounded like the click of long toenails. It sounded like a ragged stray dog loping across the pavement down a back alley in some city at 3 a.m.\nCrusoe had stopped thrashing, but something far worse had started to happen. He stared over at Floyd with eyes that had turned a sickening shade of yellow. They were now the approximate color of spoiled mustard. A choked, gurgling sound rose from Crusoe's throat like a curse, and thick jets of blood suddenly erupted from his mouth and nose, showering the air with red droplets.\n\"What is happening?!\" Floyd screamed, dropping his gun out of sheer panic.\nArthur continued to let out his racking coughs and growls, only now he'd begun to drag himself along the floor towards Floyd. The monstrous thing that used to be Arthur Crusoe dragged its gun along behind, its mangled leather strap still twisted tightly around one shoulder. Floyd watched in frozen horror as thick, brown fur began to sprout from his comrade's face.\nBefore he had time to reflect further on this development, a tremendous howl erupted from the upper deck, and his blood ran cold.\n\"Arthur,\" he pleaded, knowing it was useless but wanting to try anyway, \"snap out of it man! You've got to help me!\" He turned and aimed his gun at the spaces where the big glass windows had once been, and where he thought the howls had come from, but then it seemed like the air was suddenly saturated with sound; barks and moans and wet clacking noises that could only a large predator snapping its jaws open and shut.\nFloyd gripped his automatic so hard that he thought his knuckles might break. Behind him, Crusoe arched his back and flashed those hideous yellow eyes while drool and more unintelligible yammering continued to stream from his mouth. He now looked like a rabid wolf preparing to charge. And had his face gotten longer somehow? Floyd felt that he had to be hallucinating, but then again, he was dead, so it seemed like pretty much all bets were off. Forcing himself to ignore Crusoe, he took a deep breath, then stood up and aimed his gun towards where he thought the animal sounds seemed loudest.\nAll of a sudden, everything became quiet and still - even Crusoe. No one appeared. Floyd spun about wildly, waiting for the inevitable ambush, and that was when the first creature landed behind him with a massive whump.\nHe turned to see a beast that made his most horrible nightmares look like a Disney movie. The freakish thing was covered with bristles like a warthog, its back a ridge of razor-sharp spines. Mustard-yellow eyes bulged from its undeniably wolf-like head, and nine-inch claws sprouted from its hands and feet. The tattered remains of an SS uniform clung to its vaguely humanoid frame. A billed cap bearing the death's head emblem completed the ensemble, somehow having managed to stayed seated on the beast's misshapen skull.\nTwo more thumps resounded behind him to his left and right as more creatures leapt to the ground. Floyd instantly realized they had him trapped.\nCrusoe continued to transform, now starting to resemble the other creatures more and more. In spite of the circumstances, Floyd forced himself not to panic through sheer force of mind over matter. He squeezed the trigger and felt the weapon buck in his hands as he emptied half a magazine into the nearest beast. He was scarcely surprised when the thing shuddered its way through the hail of gunfire as though it were nothing more than a cloud of black flies. The wounds, if they could even be called that, bled no more than a spurt or two before closing up and disappearing altogether.\nSuddenly a hand - or, to be more precise, a gnarled claw - seized his ankle. He looked down to see his old cellmate now completely transformed into a hairy, shivering mess of yellow eyes, fangs, and talons. What was still visible of his chin was now thickly coated with blood and spittle, as he appeared to have chewed off his own lips.\n\"HELP... ME...!\" Crusoe managed in a strangled, barely intelligible groan. He then trailed off in a series of animal noises that could no longer be interpreted as anything other than pure confusion and rage. Instinctively, Floyd kicked his claws away as hard as he could, and Crusoe - whatever was left of his essence, anyway - bellowed in pain.\nThe three hunched demons were now almost upon him, but Floyd saw an opening; the door that Crusoe had been desperately trying to open now stood unguarded, and there looked like just enough room to make a dash for it through a gap between two of the advancing werewolves.\nOne of them lunged forward, its jaws splitting the air near Floyd's face just as he feinted backwards. He could smell its breath, something like rotten eggs and human excrement mixed together on a hot day. It was now or never.\n\"Arthur!\" he cried, springing nimbly between the two other Nazis towards the door. \"I have to go now, I'm sorry! I don't know how we ended up here, or what it means but, ah, god dammit, I'm so sorry!\" He was crying now. Pride be damned.\nNow at the door, Floyd gripped the handle and wrenched it open. He felt incredibly strong in that moment, like maybe there really was a chance that he could come back to life after all.\nHe peered through the doorway. To his utter amazement, what greeted his eyes was nothing but an utterly infinite expanse of clear, blue sky. His pupils dilated and his breath hitched abruptly in his throat. Nothing had prepared him for this. He heard the roars and wet splattering sounds behind him but could not look back just yet. He leaned over the edge and discovered that he could even make out a few wispy clouds down below. Everywhere there was only sky.\nHe took a deep breath, and it tasted as sweet as any fresh air he had breathed during his short time on Earth. The air smelled of warm soil and freshly mown grass. At last he tore his gaze away from the blue void to look back at Crusoe, although he already knew what he would see.\nThe creatures were tearing him apart.\nThe scene filled up his vision until it was all that he could perceive, all that his world contained: fur and claws and gouts of blood as they savagely buried their muzzles into every vulnerable part of Crusoe's half-transformed body. They seemed to have lost all interest in Floyd, turning their full attention to the dismemberment of Arthur Crusoe.\nThere was nothing Floyd could do for him now. His shrieks and garbled high-pitched yelps had already begun to abate, and Floyd saw that his head was now hanging on by only a few gory strips of flesh. One torn-off arm lay forgotten to one side where the creatures had flung it, and the floors were becoming saturated even further with blood. Floyd could scarcely stand it any longer. A choked sob escaped from his lips as he finally averted his gaze.\n\"Forgive me,\" he gasped. Then, he hurled himself headfirst through the doorway, into some whatever world lay in store for him next.\nHis shredded fatigues flapped in the breeze as he fell - they were little more than rags at this point - but there was no panicky sensation that he was tumbling out of control. His first instinct, of course, was to reorient himself so he could take a look at what he'd just tumbled out of.\nHe could hardly believe his eyes.\nHis best guess was that he was looking up at an enormous (though rapidly receding) prison complex. The uniform bars on the rows of windows could have held untold numbers of prisoners, perhaps on their way from one world to the next, but captured and brought here for some unknown reason. He knew there was really no telling how many souls could be trapped in there, or how vastly the structure might expand within itself. He and Crusoe had been locked up somewhere in its bowels, that much was certain, but the building remained more or less inscrutable from the outside.\nWhat had it all been for? A macabre rite of passage to gain entry into paradise? It seemed the most logical explanation, and perhaps he'd had to go through his worst nightmares of the war to get here precisely because he'd been killed in the war. Suddenly, sensing something, Floyd reached down to lift up his shirt, exposing his belly. The grotesque hallmarks of his disembowelment at the hands of that monstrous soldier in his past life were gone. There wasn't a trace - he ran his hands over skin that was now completely smooth, and felt no pain. He marveled at how light his body felt.\nBut that didn't explain Crusoe. He had died in a hospital surrounded by his loved ones 50 years after the last German surrendered, at least that was what he had told him. But Floyd and Crusoe had both fought in the war. They had that much in common. Perhaps just by participating, by taking up arms and attempting to kill their fellow man, they had unwittingly stained their souls with indelible ink that only worked to ensnare them after they'd shuffled off this mortal coil, regardless of the circumstances. And surely there was a larger universe out there, in this afterlife, but did those terrifying creatures inhabit all of it? He wondered what Crusoe had seen before he'd wound up in the cell next to him, but they had run out of time to discuss it.\nWhat he did know was that the sky around him had grown brighter, warmer somehow, like the comforting glow of those special lightbulbs his mom used to put in his reading lamp for him when he was little. The air ruffling his clothes now felt like a sea breeze on a sunny day in Hawaii. A rush of ecstasy flooded through his veins like nothing he'd ever thought possible. The prison in the sky was already the size of a pea, and in another moment or two it would dwindle out of sight altogether.\nFloyd closed his eyes, and waited for the current to take him home."}

His head pounded from several glasses of good scotch and more than one cigar he had shared with John Brixton in the officers' mess tent the night before. He had just awakened from the most peaceful dream that he was out boating on a lake somewhere in southern England with his wife and daughter. His wife had been gussied up in a cornflower-blue sundress with a matching ribbon in her hair, and looked as gorgeous as the day he'd married her. Ellen, his 12-year old little girl, wore a white hat and handled the rowing.  \"Leave it to me Daddy, I can take care of it!\" she'd said, just before the crackle of gunshots off to the east had stirred him from his desert slumber.\nHe correctly guessed that several of the recruits had elected to take target practice on the local flora and fauna again. He stepped out to surmise the camp, stretching and yawning like a lion emerging from its cave after a long nap. He looked the part as well, with a week-old beard sprouting from his cheeks to match shoulder-length blonde hair. Not exactly regulation, but this was Africa, after all. The men had hastily erected their campsite last night after successfully completing their first day out on patrol. That had been uneventful, aside from a sniper who had taken a potshot at the lead jeep from some sort of mud hut about 100 yards away from the column. Brixton, acting as heavy gunner, had angled the mounted Bren onto the enemy's position and made short work of the structure, obliterating the man inside in the process. Every Englishman in attendance had applauded when it was done.\n\"Bleeding hell! Get those tent stakes pulled up, on the double I say!\" Madsen heard a familiar voice shouting from the other side of the bivouac. He made his way over.\n\"Lieutenant Pendleton, should you be harassing the men this early?\" the Captain said, announcing his presence in a booming tone.\nThe brash young lieutenant turned, caught by surprise. \"Err, sorry, sir, but we have to be ready to leave in 20 minutes. Orders came early this morning from the top. We're to investigate a certain outpost, buggered away somewhere in the desert. Said we ought to find something of significant interest out there, and not to bother coming back without conducting a thorough investigation of the base.\"\nMadsen tightened his belt and wondered whether he'd be ready to depart on such short notice. He desperately needed to move his bowels, and the fact of this difficult mission instantly began to weigh on his mind. The German platoons out there were dug in like ticks, and mostly insane from the nightmarish desert conditions. He faintly recalled hearing about an artillery crew that had resorted to cannibalism after getting caught completely off-guard by a sandstorm that had driven them deep into the wilderness, never to return.\n\"That's fine, I'll take the second jeep with Brixton. The man's good with a Sten gun. They mention what we might expect in terms of enemy resistance?\"\n\"Intel reports heavy convoys moving west toward El Alamein, and scouts have spotted some German anti-aircraft guns positioned on the escarpment to our west where we'll be heading. I don't suppose you know a good designated marksman for this mission, eh? It might be good to try and pick off some gun crews.\"\n\"I may know one or two,\" the captain replied. Brixton was possibly the best shot he could think of, but maybe one of the recruits would be up to the task. They certainly ought to be, with the amount of time they spent trying to pick off wildlife around the camp.\nPendleton gave Madsen a quick salute, then quickly became reabsorbed in wrapping up the campsite. Sensing what might be his final opportunity for a while. Captain Madsen hurried off in the direction of the makeshift latrines.\n\n*******"}

Sensing what might be his final opportunity for a while. Captain Madsen hurried off in the direction of the makeshift latrines.\n\n*******\n\nThey hadn't been on the road more than 45 minutes before they met their first enemy. He was a boy holding a rifle, and he had on an oversized infantryman's uniform with a grey steel helmet. The line of jeeps ambled to a hesitant stop about 200 meters away. John Brixton sat beside Madsen in the second jeep. His trusty Sten gun was cradled in his lap, and he knew that he would have no qualms about splattering the boy's insides all over the place, should the distant figure on the dune raise that old Karabiner so much as one inch.\nPendleton gazed through his field glasses at the strange sentry from the lead jeep, then called back to Madsen.\n\" 'e's no more than fifteen if he's a day, sir. Do we take him prisoner?\"\n\"Haven't got enough supplies to feed another mouth,\" Madsen yelled back. He cinched his neck wrap tighter as a gust of dry wind buffeted the side of his face.\n\"He might know something!\" said Pendleton, raising the binoculars once more. Brixton nervously checked his weapon. Teenager or not, this lad was sure as hell wearing a German uniform.\n\"What on earth is he talking about,\" Brixton muttered. \"Pendleton and that bleeding heart of his again.\"\nMadsen ignored him. \"Take your two comrades there, and try to bring him into custody. If he resists or attempts to aim that ghastly rifle at you, take him out, but do be quick about it.\"\nPendleton hopped out of the lead vehicle and unholstered his sidearm. Two other privates backed him up, and they cautiously approached the enemy soldier's position. Having taken some German lessons in college just prior to the war, Pendleton called out a command for the boy to put down his rifle.\nThere was no immediate response. Pendleton began to think that either his German hadn't made sense, or his words had been snatched away by a gust of wind, never to be heard. Whatever the case, he had just begun to repeat his order when suddenly the lad raised his battered old rifle and fired.\nThe bullet tore the approaching lieutenant's right ear clean off his head.\nThings happened very quickly after that. Sergeant Brixton fired two bursts at the silhouette on the dune, then watched it shudder as several of the rounds struck home. The young soldier staggered forward and toppled over into the sand like a drunk at the end of his rope. There was a soft thud when he hit, and then all was still. Pendleton was screaming in pain.\nMadsen sat completely still, a white-knuckled grip on the jeep's steering wheel. The deafening report of Brixton's gun had caught him by surprise, and a cacophonous ringing now pounded in his ears. He watched as the sergeant hustled over to Pendleton, who continued to holler. The big gunner dropped to one knee and tore off his own neck wrap to bandage the man's head, tying it vertically with expert fingers.\nPulling himself together, Madsen climbed out of the second jeep, and strode over to survey the damage. A small puddle of blood had begun to coagulate in the sand where Pendleton had initially fallen, but a far larger one had accumulated beneath the body of the German who now lay face down, and quite dead.\n\"Check the body for intelligence,\" Madsen said, his voice regaining confidence as he snapped off the order like a whip.\n\"Yes, captain,\" the two closest recruits replied in unison. They crouched down to filter through the dead boy's pockets.\nBrixton said to Madsen as he tended to Pendleton, \"The bloody savage blew 'is ear clean off, but he'll live. Quite fortunate, considering. We've got to get back underway.\"\nPendleton groaned as they helped him back to his vehicle. The other men finished searching the body and came over to Madsen with something in hand. He looked at it with interest.\n\"Well?\" he said.\n\"Some sort of journal, sir, along with a map,\" said Phil Wembley, seeming excited. He was a nervous chap whose hair always appeared to be grimy with either perspiration or grease. He was holding up a small leather diary that seemed to have several strange symbols scratched onto the cover.\n\"Splendid. Let's have a look at it back in the jeep. Private Wembley, you're with me.\" Madsen turned to the other man, Corporal James Bulger. \"Let's go. You too, Bulger. I've got a job I want to talk to you about. I hear you're quite the marksman.\"\nMadsen, Bulger, and Wembley all hopped in and got situated. Bulger keyed the ignition and set the engine roaring into life. Within five minutes the whole convoy had gotten rolling once more.\nThe corpse of the German youth lay all but forgotten in the African dirt, and the first vultures had already begun to circle overhead."}

Brixton, driving the lead jeep, tugged at his moustache self-consciously while stealing sidelong glances at Pendleton to check his condition. The lieutenant had slipped into a dazed slumber, probably owing in part to the shock of his near-death experience. Brixton would force him to hydrate and take some pain tablets when he woke up; in the meantime he'd probably be all right. Might even still be able to fight, God willing. They didn't have much farther to go. Judging from the last time he'd had a chance to take a careful look at the map, the convoy would arrive in the vicinity of the outpost within two hours.\nAbout 30 meters back, Madsen kept his eyes trained on the road and Brixton's vehicle ahead.\n\"Any luck with that journal?\" he asked Wembley.\n\"Well, I don't speak a lick of German, but the writing sure seems...  erratic. Lots of exclamation points, jagged letters... It's as though something disturbed him terribly, though I haven't the foggiest notion what it could have been.\"\n\"Maybe Pendleton can have a look when we stop, if he's awake,\" Bulger offered.\n\"Aye, I don't know anyone else in this squad who speaks jerry. Very well, then. Anything else you were able to deduce, private?\"\n\"Not much sir, but this map matches ours and he's marked out a location with an X. It's the same spot as we've got for the outpost!\"\n\"Bloody hell,\" Madsen muttered. There went any slim chance of the place being deserted, assuming the teenage scout had been part of a larger force.\nBulger piped up again: \"So what was that job you wanted to talk to me about, sir?\"\n\n*******"}

There went any slim chance of the place being deserted, assuming the teenage scout had been part of a larger force.\nBulger piped up again: \"So what was that job you wanted to talk to me about, sir?\"\n\n*******\n\nUpon their arrival and under Madsen's orders, the men circled the jeeps like a band of pioneer wagons behind a fairly large dune. Corporal Bulger lay sprawled on its ridge, looking through his scope at a small cluster of buildings that made up the outpost. They looked shockingly ordinary. Madsen had entrusted him with the scoped Enfield after their conversation in the jeep about an hour before. Bulger knew in his own heart that he had every confidence in being able to handle the role, but something still bothered him about the lack of activity he observed down below. Something evil lurked in those buildings; of that he was becoming practically certain.\nAs if on cue, a dark pall (which had seemingly developed out of nowhere) began to roll across the sky, completely obscuring the sun in the span of only about five minutes. Madsen got prone next to Bulger, acting as his spotter with a pair of binoculars. The rest of the men milled about anxiously below.\nPendleton seemed to have gathered his wits about him after the harrowing injury. Brixton smoked in silence nearby. The other privates, who had filled out the group - Phil Wembley, Tony Gallant, Alex Nedry, and Ben Stonem - were checking their weapons and talking in hushed tones.\nDry, hot wind blew a fresh blast of grit against Wembley's chest and face, though fortunately he had on his black goggles, which frankly were a goddamn lifesaver in such conditions, he thought. Alex Nedry was bragging about his French girlfriend again. As a lovelorn virgin, Wembley usually found himself both irritated and fascinated by Nedry's accounts of his various sexual exploits, although he suspected that Nedry took a fair amount of creative liberty with many of his tales.\nWembley looked up nervously toward where Bulger and Captain Madsen were surveying the cluster of buildings. Christ, but he had a bad feeling about going in there. If some situation came down to either looking like a goddamn English national hero or saving his own hide, he was going to take his own hide every time. This was not something he would admit to anyone but himself, however.\nBulger and the captain ambled down the hill to rejoin the group.\n\"What'd you see up there?\" Brixton asked, stubbing out his cigarette.\n\"A good bit of nothing,\" said Madsen. \"One main structure that looked like it might house their barracks and headquarters, and then a fuel and ammo dump around the back. There are a few other smaller out-buildings around the main one, probably a single-occupancy guardhouse, along with some latrines by the looks of it.\"\nPendleton raised his head. \"You didn't see anyone moving around?\" he asked.\n\"Not a soul,\" said Bulger. \"Quiet as a morgue.\"\n\"Well, my ear is fucking killing me, so if the lot of you could get in and out quickly that would be just bloody wonderful.\" His squeaky voice grated on Madsen's ears even more than usual. Seemed like just about anyone else in the platoon would have kept a stiff upper lip about the injury, but not Pendleton.\n\"Right, Sergeant Brixton and I will each take a squad and rush up from both sides,\" Madsen said. He drew his Fairbairn-Sykes combat knife and began to scratch a rough diagram in the sand as he spoke. \"Corporal Bulger, you cover us from the hill. Pick off anything that moves.\"\n\"Understood,\" said Bulger.\n\"Pendleton, you stay here with Bulger. Stonem, Nedry, you lads are with me. Wembley and Gallant, you're with Sergeant Brixton. When we move, we'll take the left and you'll take the right flank, and we'll work our way to the entrance of the main building. Any questions?\"\nHe glanced around at the group. The younger men were an unproven bunch, and most appeared to be clutching their weapons for comfort. Phil Wembley looked particularly pale and Madsen wondered if the guy had even started to shave yet. Alex Nedry, by comparison, looked cocksure and ready, resting his Enfield rifle confidently over one shoulder.\n\"Let's roll, Captain. I'm ready to split some Nazi skulls,\" Nedry said."}

Madsen looked back over his shoulder and saw the telltale glint of the scope of Bulger's rifle while he scanned the area. He better get that glare under control or the wrong person is liable to spot him, Madsen thought.\nThey moved fast across the cracked hardpan that surrounded the immediate clearing where the buildings stood. Madsen, Nedry, and Stonem hustled up to a low wall that separated them from the central building's main courtyard, their equipment clanking heavily. Brixton and his boys posted up about 50 meters away at another section of wall. Madsen checked his six one last time, then looked forward and judged that they were ready to make a break for the door.\nBrixton signaled to Madsen that his group was good to go. He glanced over at the two privates with him and saw that Wembley had turned a rather sickly shade of green, but Tony Gallant looked confident and ready to fight. Wembley also looked even sweatier than usual, but Brixton guessed that a little trial by fire might be just what the doctor ordered for this young milksop.\n\"Check your weapons, lads,\" Brixton whispered. Gallant pulled back the slide on his Enfield to make sure a round was chambered, then shoved it back home with a hearty clack.\n\"Locked and loaded.\"\nWith the sly momentum of foxes hunting some elusive prey, both groups broke from cover and crossed the courtyard to the stucco building's front door. The wood was cracked and rotted, and hung from its frame on ancient leather hinges. One kick from Brixton's boot was enough to send it crashing inward, sending up a dense cloud of dust and splinters in its wake.\n\"Inside, now!\" Madsen shouted, and the men filtered through the doorway single-file, pointing their guns ahead of them, checking every corner as they hustled down the hall.\nIt was at that moment that they heard a resounding, barely human groan come from the room at the opposite end of the hallway. Wembley's blood ran cold at the sound, which more closely resembled a wounded animal than any noise he'd ever heard a man make.\n\"Christ,\" Brixton muttered. \"What in God's name was that?\"\n\"Wembley, you and Gallant get down there and check it out,\" Madsen ordered.\nSwallowing hard against the rising fear in their hearts, the two privates made their way toward the room at the rear of the building. Before they had taken three steps, however, another monstrous groan floated through the air.\n\"Help... me...\" the voice said. Wembley felt as though someone was manipulating his legs for him, moving them toward whatever horror awaited them behind that door. At last, he moved into the room with Gallant right behind him. It felt like he was walking through a dream.\nWhat he saw was enough to make his breakfast come surging up his gullet almost instantly. Wembley vomited in the corner while Gallant brought a hand up to his nose to dampen the putrid odor that saturated the air, something like mayonnaise that had been left out in the sun. Before them, on a wide table, lay a man. He was naked, save for a threadbare pair of cotton shorts, and bound to posts affixed to each corner by...  Good Christ, Gallant thought, is that barbed wire? It was. A huge suture scar cut across the hapless lad's belly, crisscrossed by black stitches that looked to have been done hurriedly and without much experience. Blood oozed from dozens of cuts in his wrists and ankles where the barbs had poked through.\nThe last detail was the worst of all, though.\nAlmost all of the skin and muscle had been stripped from his right arm.\nGallant felt his knees go weak, but quickly braced himself against the door and managed to gather his wits. \"Captain, we've got a situation in here!\" he shouted over his shoulder.\nWembley spat out more bile and wiped his lips with the back of his hand. The man on the butchering table made a pitiful attempt to raise his head, then gave up with a shriek of pain. He sounded like a wolf whose leg had been caught in a particularly vicious trap.\nThe rest of the squad burst into the room. A low moan escaped Nedry's throat, and the commandos stood staring, unable to comprehend the horror that lay before them.\n\"Please... kill me,\" the man gasped.\nMadsen walked over to him, trying to keep his composure from wavering.\n\"Who did this to you?\" he said in a gentle voice. He glanced at the barbed wire that held the victim to the table and knew that it would take hours to remove it, likely killing the poor soul in the process.\n\"They're.. in the basement,\" he stammered. He spoke with an American accent, and a tattoo of a P-51 Mustang graced his left breast. Madsen knew he was not long for this world.\nThe men glanced around nervously, half-expecting someone to burst out of one of the rooms they'd passed in the hallway. The thought of going into the basement terrified them, but the dire need to make someone pay for this savagery held sway above all."}

The thought of going into the basement terrified them, but the dire need to make someone pay for this savagery held sway above all.\n\n*******\n\nOutside on the hill, Bulger eyed the landscape through his scope after having watched his comrades force their way into the main building. A shudder of movement caught his attention; he thought he could see something in a big thorny bush near the front door. He glided the crosshairs of his scope over it, waiting for whatever might be in there to reveal itself. He concentrated on his breathing, ready to take a shot if any sort of threat emerged. It was at that moment that he felt a frantic tapping on his shoulder: Pendleton.\n\"Christ, man, I've got movement down there! What is it?\"\n\"You're not going to fucking believe this, Bulger. I finally managed to translate a few pieces of that journal we picked off the kid.\"\nBulger put down his rifle - just for a minute - and turned to look at Pendleton. There was fear and surprise written all over his bandaged-up face.\n\"Well, based on the map that matches ours, we know he was definitely based out of this outpost.\"\nBulger waited patiently. His mind itched to know what might be hiding in that bush, and he knew Madsen would kill him if he let anything slip by unnoticed. Far worse, it could lead to his own friends getting killed.\n\"Spit it out, man!\"\n\"Bulger, he calls this place a Metzgerei. That means it's a bloody meat market!\"\n\n*******\n\nThe American on the table drew one final, shuddering breath, and then he died. The men stared at his body, deeply shocked and yet itching to carry on with the mission.\n\"Can't stand around all day, boys. Time to sack up and see what's in the basement,\" Madsen said. Wembley looked like he might be sick all over again. The small, hot room still reeked of his stomach juices.\nThey checked their weapons one last time and filed out the door with Madsen leading the way. Their rubber-soled track shoes beat a hasty path across the floorboards.\nThey moved down the hallway, then turned a corner that opened up onto a slightly recessed stairwell. Stone steps appeared to spiral downward around another corner and out of sight into darkness, descending into the heart of the building.\nMadsen wiped one sweaty palm against his trousers while he adjusted his grip on his weapon.  \"Private Stonem, come up here with that torch,\" he said.\nThe younger man dutifully hustled to the front of the line while pulling a scuffed-up flashlight from his utility belt. He handed it to Madsen who clicked it on and shined it around the corner of the stairway. Cobwebs coated every possible corner and crevasse, and dozens of unnamable insects skittered about ahead of Madsen's advancing torch beam.\n\"Christ, Captain, do we really have to go down there?\" Stonem asked, already full well knowing the answer.\n\"Afraid so. If we come back empty-handed, there'll be hell to pay,\" Madsen replied in a weary tone.\nSecond in line, Brixton wore an expression that was as grim as death. The other young enlisted men seemed to have recovered from their earlier bouts of queasiness, and they looked more or less ready to fight.\nMadsen briefly flirted with the idea of holding off on the descent in order to go back outside and warn Bulger and Pendleton of the situation, but decided against it. Time was too precious. With a rapidly developing certainty, he felt that if they didn't hurry, they'd wind up exactly like that unfortunate soul on the slab.\n\"Are you sure we have enough manpower to handle whatever might be down there?\" Brixton asked.\n\"If the six of us aren't enough, then may God have mercy on us all,\" Madsen said.\n\n*******"}

To stay alive out here, I mean. Either that or they've just gotten a taste for it and don't want to stop.\"\nBulger's mind swam in confusion. \"What... what are you talking about?\"\n\"People, Bulger! Prisoners, German soldiers who got sick, wandering nomads - the goddamn Nazis are slicing them up for meat!\"\nBulger didn't have time for such ravings. He put his eye to the scope again. Pendleton began to protest, begging him to listen and heed the danger they were in.\nBulger zeroed in once more on the thorn bush. Every fiber in his body told him something was hiding in there. Maybe just a desert fox. Maybe something larger. His trigger finger itched badly, tempting him to take a shot just for the hell of it.\nCome on... show yourself, Bulger thought. He had ceased to scan the rest of the area, aiming instead, obsessively, at the dead piece of shrubbery. Why the hell not, he thought. A bead of sweat dripped into his right eye. Bulger ignored it. Nothing could touch him now. He felt like a god as his pressure on the trigger increased to one pound, then two. Three-point-four would do the trick. The shot would come in the next millisecond.\nThen, rising up like a nightmare planetside pockmarked with craters, a deeply scarred surface that was barely recognizable as a human face suddenly blocked his field of vision through the scope. Below that, a freakish set of brown, gnarled teeth grinned at him like rotting tree stumps. Bulger jerked backwards in violent surprise.\nBehind him, Pendleton began to scream.\n... crept around... up the front of the dune somehow... impossible, Bulger thought in a surreal daze. He scrambled backwards in a panic, dropping the sniper rifle. Standing before him was a freakish giant with a thick black beard, and dressed head to toe in leather Nazi regalia. His beard appeared to be soaked in blood. On his hip he sported a Luger, and a long-barreled rifle hung jauntily over one shoulder. It looked like it might have been standard-issue in the Prussian Army in about 1915. The weapon of choice was something else, however.\nAt his side, he held an enormous butcher knife.\nThe brute saw with delight that he had taken the two Englishmen completely by surprise. His bloodshot eyes bulged at the seams in anticipation of the kill. To Bulger's abject horror, he lowered his head and charged.\nThe butcher knife whickered through the air as it sought its victim. Bulger threw his arms up in desperation to block the blows, but the maniac quickly opened up several large gashes on his forearms as he fought to defend himself.\nA few feet away, Pendleton fumbled for his sidearm, frantically trying to undo the clasp of his holster. Gouts of blood and clouds of dust sprayed in the air as Bulger and his opponent locked each other in mortal combat. The sleeves of Bulger's uniform already hung in bloody tatters. At last Pendleton shook the revolver free and leveled it at the attacker.\nHis hands shook and he cursed himself for not being able to line up a clean shot. Bulger's screams seemed to increase in pitch, rising in a desperate crescendo as the German continued to slash him into submission. The sniper rifle lay forgotten off to one side.\n\"Pendleton, HELP ME!\" Bulger cried as the enemy brought down two more devastating blows on the commando's upraised hands. The strike cleanly severed three of the fingers on his right hand and sent them flying through the air; the second blow sank deep into the meat between his left thumb and forefinger with a dull thwack, and got lodged there. The Nazi shook the blade in an attempt to free it, chips of bone and gobs of blood spattering left and right. Bulger stared up into the burning desert sun, his vision already starting to ebb as his blood continued to leak onto the sand, and saw that the thumb was now hanging on by nothing but a loose hinge of tendons and gristle. The remaining fingers dangled uselessly from his destroyed appendage.\nThe cannibal either hadn't noticed Pendleton trying to line up his shot, or just didn't care. Bulger threw his head back to let out one final bellow of pain, his ruined hands unable to block any more of that relentless steel. The cannibal easily forced his arms apart and put his knees on his shoulders. It was all over. Bulger began to weep.\nThe brute brought the cleaver straight down on his face with a mighty tomahawk swing, splitting Bulger's forehead, nose, and mouth almost completely in two. A handful of his teeth went flying in opposite directions, and his eyes rolled back in his head. The blue sparkle in them that had charmed so many young lassies back in London flickered one final time, and then went out for good.\nThe German pulled back on the knife, which popped loose from Bulger's face with a sound that would sicken even the hardest of men. Pendleton, meanwhile, seemed as though he had completely forgotten he was holding a pistol. For a second, he was too shocked by the death of his friend to do anything but gape, but with the blade now free, the big desert cannibal reared up to his full height and turned his attention to the lieutenant, now channeling his entire bloody rage upon the final man to finish the job. Sensing what might be his last moments on Earth, Pendleton finally managed to shoot.\nThe first two rounds went flying over the Nazi's head, which caused him to look up as though nothing more bothersome than a couple of gnats had zipped by. The next three, however, found their target, high and tight on the chest, and the man's body shook with the impact. He took two more lurching steps forward, cleaver raised menacingly. It twinkled brilliantly in the sun.\nPendleton squeezed off the last shot directly into the giant's left eye.\nThe man had enough forward momentum to collapse hard into the commando, and he cried out, although mainly in relief, as he shoved the body away from him in disgust. He landed hard on the ground near Bulger's corpse.\nPendleton sank to his knees and thanked God that he was somehow still breathing. A lizard scuttled into the shade made by one jeep's front wheel well. The sun continued to bake the desert floor, and it was just past 1 o'clock in the afternoon."}

The sun continued to bake the desert floor, and it was just past 1 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\n*******\n\nMadsen stepped forward as he brushed an enormous patch of cobwebs out of the way. The stuff was so thick that it almost felt like a silk bedsheet beneath his outstretched palm. He moved carefully down the steps, and was reassured by the sound of his men falling into stride behind him. The air grew noticeably cooler with each downward step, which came as a welcome relief after all the hours they'd spent under the relentless desert sun.\nIt felt like an eternity had gone by before the next break in the silence. They'd been walking downstairs for what must have been nearly 10 minutes, and it was already quite clear that they had gone much deeper than any one of them had expected to go - most of all Madsen. We should have gone back to check with Pendleton and Bulger.\nHis thoughts were suddenly interrupted when his feet, expecting yet another step, landed instead on solid concrete floor. The squad behind him descended the last few steps, and they all looked about in the gloom. Madsen still had the flashlight and shined it around in a circle, revealing what appeared to be some sort of antechamber. Suddenly, he stopped.\nDirectly opposite them stood a massive steel door.\n\n*******\n\nPendleton checked the pockets of the dead Nazi while choking back tears of rage. He knew he couldn't absorb the blame for Bulger's death for not taking the shot - something evil was at work in this godforsaken outpost, and this maniacal henchman had taken both of them completely by surprise. He'd fought as best he knew how, but that was of little consolation at the present moment.\nThere was work to be done. He'd found nothing in the dead man's pockets except for a bloody grapefruit spoon, which he stared at for a moment in horrified fascination before tossing away in disgust. The only items of value were the rifle and the Luger. At least now he had some extra firepower.\nHe forced himself not to look at Bulger's devastating facial wound. As his heart rate climbed up again, the pounding got worse in the area of his ruined ear. Not for the first time, he wondered why he hadn't asked his father to pull some strings to let him stay at Oxford, but he'd surely wanted to see action, hadn't he? It had been his own decision. Now, he was getting all that he could stand, and more.\nHe slid down the sand dune. He had to warn Madsen and the others at any cost. There was no longer any doubt in his mind that the mission was headed for a total disaster.\nAt the base of the dune, he stumbled a bit in the loose sand, then regained his footing. Christ was he ever drenched in sweat! The main building loomed against the horizon in the hazy afternoon sun and he continued to make his way forward.\nHe would find them in there, warn them, and be the hero he was meant to be. Not like before, when they'd all laughed at him for getting his ear shot off by a mere boy. No, he would redeem himself, and the glory of this mission would be rightfully his.\nHe'd gotten almost to the wooden door when he caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of his eye. It was too obvious to ignore.\nA deep pit instantly formed in his stomach as he realized how stupid he'd been, rushing ahead like this without checking if the coast had been clear. He spun around and tried to raise his rifle, but it was too late.\nThe butt of a trench gun slammed into the side of his head, and Pendleton was knocked violently into the dust.\n\n*******"}

No, he would redeem himself, and the glory of this mission would be rightfully his.\nHe'd gotten almost to the wooden door when he caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of his eye. It was too obvious to ignore.\nA deep pit instantly formed in his stomach as he realized how stupid he'd been, rushing ahead like this without checking if the coast had been clear. He spun around and tried to raise his rifle, but it was too late.\nThe butt of a trench gun slammed into the side of his head, and Pendleton was knocked violently into the dust.\n\n*******\n\nMadsen stared at the door. It beckoned to him.\nHe turned around to ask Brixton how he thought they should proceed. He stepped backwards as he half-turned, and even got so far as to open his mouth to speak, but that was when he felt a grinding, stone movement under his foot. His heart dropped into his stomach.\nA massive arrow, almost more like a javelin really, came barreling through the cool, damp basement air. Brixton thought he just had time to see Madsen's eyes widen in surprise as he realized he was standing right in its path.\nThe spear hit Captain Madsen like runaway freight train and impaled him against the opposite wall. His sternum exploded outward upon impact like a rotten jack-o-lantern. The captain gave a jerk, and opened his mouth as if to say something; then, his head fell limp.\nBrixton and the other men hit the deck as fast as they could, trying to determine where the steel projectile had come from. The flashlight Madsen had been carrying clattered to the ground beside his torn-apart body, and the big gunner crawled over to snatch it up. Now armed with light, he looked around with and almost immediately spotted a large slit in the wall about five meters to the right of where Madsen had been standing. It was the kind of opening that medieval archers might have used, back when a longbow was the most lethal weapon known to man. The only thing Brixton wasn't sure of was whether someone had live-fired the spear or not. He answered his own question by looking at the place on the floor where Madsen had stepped.\nBuilt into the floor was a perfectly square stone panel. Brixton now realized that Madsen's weight must have triggered it just before the arrow had gone flying through the air on its lethal course.\n\"Stay low, boys, and watch your goddamn step,\" Brixton said to his remaining men. They did as they were told.\n\"What the fuck do we do now, sergeant?\" hissed Wembley.\n\"Fucked if I know. Whatever HQ sent us here for is most likely behind that door. I say we better try to get in there, one way or the other.\"\n\"This whole place could be rigged!\" Gallant said, losing more of his nerve with every additional second that he stared at Madsen's ragged body. The dead captain's blonde hair hung loosely in his face. He'd been stuck to the wall a such a height that his feet brushed the floor, and one almost could have thought he was standing up on his own, were it not for the massive steel rod projecting from his sternum, of course.\n\"That may be,\" Brixton said, \"but it seems to me that poor old Archie must have already triggered the brunt of it.\" He motioned to the panel that Madsen had clearly stepped on.\nThe five remaining commandos got to their feet ever so carefully. The small stone chamber in which they found themselves was already beginning to fill with the copper smell of Madsen's blood (along with something else too, Wembley thought, but he didn't allow his mind to go there). There was nothing left now but to find out what was behind that door. Brixton strode forward and reached for the handle.\nTo the sergeant's surprise, it turned easily in his grasp. Behind him, the privates raised their rifles in anticipation of the platoon of psychotic desert Nazis they had each conjured up in their minds.\n\"This is it lads,\" Brixton said. Without another pause, he shoved the door wide open and the men poured into the room, rifles out and sweeping in every direction.\nThey stopped. The room was empty.\nWell, not quite.\nThe space was incredibly large, shaped like the trailer of an 18-wheeled lorry. The first thing they noticed was the temperature. It was as though they had stepped into a walk-in freezer. As if to immediately confirm their suspicions, they looked up to see an ornate row of large steel hooks dangling from the ceiling. From at least a half-dozen of them, there hung flayed human bodies. The pale red meat of their muscles glistened sharply in the fluorescent light that filled the chamber.\nThey quickly ascertained that aside from the bodies, there was no one else in the room. Despite the horror all five of them felt, this came as somewhat of a relief.\n\"Fucking savages!\" Brixton growled.\n\"They've been ... butchering up their own men, sarge,\" Stonem said, unable to contain the disgust in his voice.\nBrixton spat. \"Aye, it looks that way. Nothing we can do for these poor souls now.\"\n\"What the fuck was the intelligence that HQ wanted us to retrieve?\" Gallant said, his voice trembling with emotion.\nBrixton shook his head and continued to scan the room, not knowing the answer. He shuddered at the cold that had already worked its way into his bones.\nIt was at that moment that heavy stomping from above broke the silence. The men stiffened and turned around, clutching their weapons. Wembley tried to get his knees to stop quavering, but with little success. It sounded like a half-dozen sets of boots were marching down the steps. They did not all sound the same, however. There was an odd stumbling, dragging sound to it, as if one of the group were being forced to descend against their will.\nThe steel door stood slightly ajar. Brixton realized how stupid they'd been not to secure it behind them, but it was too late for that now.\nThe footsteps arrived at the bottom of the stairs. The Brits held their breath.\n\"Easy,\" Brixton whispered.\nThere came another muffled whump, like someone taking a hard punch to the stomach. A low moan immediately followed.\n\"Please, don't kill me,\" uttered a high British voice from behind the door.\n\"Pendleton!?\" cried out Wembley, unable to stop himself.\nGerman voices shouted in surprise just beyond the confines of the walk-in freezer, and Brixton cursed under his breath at Wembley's lack of restraint.\nBrixton charged forward, knocking Wembley out of the way as he tried to slam the door all the way shut, but at that very instant it came flying back toward him. The door slammed into the heavy gunner's forehead as someone with great strength gave it a firm shove from the other side, and stars danced across his field of vision. He managed to hang onto his Sten gun, but just barely. The subzero temperatures made the impact that much worse, and he struggled to maintain his balance. The door continued on its course and flung wide, and Brixton tried to dodge his way to safety, to little effect. He felt like he'd just gotten ten concussions, and staggered backwards into the freezer.\nJust when he thought he had gathered himself up again, a bullet slammed into his shoulder. White hot fire exploded throughout his entire upper body as his collarbone shattered. Blood spurted into the air and he spun halfway around, now to face the recruits. His face was a writhing map of surprise and pain. He knew they'd gotten him.\nHe closed his eyes.\nA slug from a German trench gun crashed through the back of Brixton's skull and out the front of his forehead with explosive force. His body toppled forward like a massive oak tree. Brains and chips of pale bone flew across the room, where much of it came to land on the front of Ben Stonem's tunic. The bullet continued on its path and ricocheted with a clang off the wall just above his head. A hail of gunfire erupted from the doorway. The muzzle flashes were blinding, and the remaining men could perceive nothing but the shouting and white fire that poured forth from the doorway.\nA flurry of 7.62mm rounds punched through Alex Nedry's right thigh and came out the other side, severing his femoral artery in three places. Blood gushed out of his body as though from a defective fire hose, and he let out a heavy gasp as he realized his life was drawing to a rapid close. A second later, he crumpled to the ground like a punctured balloon.\nStonem, Gallant, and Wembley tried to scatter and find any sort of cover. Wembley tripped and crashed to the floor face-first, the impact knocking the air out of his lungs. Wheezing hard, he crawled across the icy floor toward Brixton's body. Next to the dead man's outstretched hand lay his Sten gun, the only full automatic that the squad now had at their disposal.\nTossing his rifle, Wembley snatched up the Sten and rolled onto his side, firing a wild spray toward the door. To his right, a massive pool of blood had started seeping out from beneath Nedry's lifeless body. Gallant and Stonem cracked off potshots from their rifles, firing from the cover of two large filing cabinets that had been tucked in a back corner, hidden behind the skinned bodies that dangled from their hooks.\nWembley squeezed the trigger again, but he wasn't used to the kick of the automatic. His shots caromed around the edges of the doorframe as a band of Nazis began to surge through the opening. Their chests were draped with belts of large caliber ammunition, and tattered leather and khaki made up most of their uniforms. A large man who appeared to be their leader was wearing a necklace made of human ears. He grinned down at Wembley, whose clip had run dry. The enemy's teeth were jagged and glistened with bright red stains. To Wembley, they looked like they'd been sharpened with a file. He stared up and saw two other men join their leader on his flanks, then two more joined from the back. These last men were holding Pendleton in a very rough grip, and he looked like he was barely clinging to life after a righteous beating. He was bleeding from countless deep cuts on his face and neck, and a massive welt had risen from the side of his head. They'd also severely blackened both his eyes.\nThings went into a kind of slow-motion for Wembley after that. Gallant and Stonem were desperately trying to reload their Enfields, but before they could finish two of the nightmarish attackers raised automatic pistols and fired around two dozen shots at the defenseless privates. They both collapsed in a heap before the hail. By the door, the head cannibal, he of the grisly necklace, turned back to the others. One of the two guys at the rear holding Pendleton simultaneously whipped out a huge, rusty bayonet.\n\"Wembley, do something!\" Pendleton screamed, his voice muddy with panic. One of his captors, whose head was completely shaved, pressed the bayonet tight against Pendleton's swollen throat. Beads of blood and sweat stood out along the blade, but the leather-clad soldier hesitated to make the fatal slice.\nThe leader, still standing over Wembley, was incredibly tall. In his left hand he held an automatic pistol, which he raised to point directly at the last surviving British private. Wembley could feel that the drops of perspiration in his patchy moustache had frozen solid.\nThe Sten gun was empty, but he still had a combat knife in his boot. Mustering more bravery than he ever had before in his life, he yanked out the blade and rolled over all at once just as the big Nazi fired off a salvo from his pistol. The bullets ricocheted wildly off the floor where Wembley had laid a second earlier. Spinning, he threw the blade as hard as he could, and watched with fascination as it flew through the air and buried itself in the enemy's brawny chest with a meaty thwack.\nThe mortally wounded head cannibal staggered around the room wildly, his eyes rolling backward. The two other Nazis tried to get out of the way, but before they could, their leader reflexively squeezed off several more bursts from his weapon, accidentally killing his two comrades.\nThere was a tremendous crash as the giant stumbled into the filing cabinets at the back of the room, knocking them over in opposite directions. The drawers clanged open and spilled several sheafs  of documents across the icy floor.\nWembley's breath streamed out in long plumes as he looked up to assess the scene. Everyone was at a standstill. Gallant and Stonem lay in a pool of their own blood, their Enfields lying uselessly off to one side. The cannibal whom Wembley had taken out with a his well-placed dagger toss had finally expired in a total heap among the filing cabinets which were below the flayed corpses still dangling from their hooks.\nThat left Wembley, Pendleton, and the last two Germans, one of whom still had the bayonet pressed firmly against the lieutenant's throat. The remaining two Nazis stared frantically around, unsure of what to do next. Wembley realized that he had somehow managed to kill off most of the attacking force, and at that same moment Pendleton sprang up from his knees in a kamikaze surprise attack. Wembley stared in fascination as Pendleton snatched the rusty bayonet cleanly out of his captor's hand, turned it around, and plunged it through the man's open mouth, then out the back of his neck with a powerful thrust.\nThe German's eyes flew wide open with uncomprehending agony, and he choked out a gargled scream, but then he went limp as Pendleton twisted the blade. Meanwhile, Wembley finally found his will to fight again and scrambled across the floor for his rifle, leaving the Sten gun behind. Pendleton had turned now and was attacking the other man who had held him, but this last foe was much bigger and there wasn't much chance that Pendleton could take him alone. Wembley prayed that his rifle still had a round in the chamber.\nThere was no time to check. His fingers closed around the walnut stock and slipped into the trigger-guard with desperate impatience. He quickly whirled around and fired at the final Nazi just as it seemed as though the man was about to overwhelm his mate.\nThe report of the rifle resounded deafeningly in the small room, then quickly began to dissipate. Wembley watched in mute fascination as a red plume blossomed on the back of the German's ragged khaki shirt.\nThe cannibal sank to the ground in front of Pendleton, then fell over on his side. Wembley feared for a second that his shot had gone through and hit Pendleton as well, but the lieutenant sprang nimbly away from the dead body. He was apparently unharmed.\n\"You beautiful bastard, I thought I was done for!\" he cried. \"What do you say we bugger on out of here before more of them show up, eh?\"\nWembley slowly got to his feet. \"I'm with you, lieutenant,\" he said, then swallowed hard. \"But haven't we got to check those cabinets for intelligence?\"\nPendleton wore a dazed look on his face. He turned to look at the toppled filing cabinets, the paper contents of which lay strewn about and all over the body of the biggest cannibal.  He slowly wavered between two possible decisions, unsure which to choose. Bollocks! Of course we have to check, he finally realized.\n\"Let's go,\" he said, even though every fiber in his body told him to turn around and run for the hills. They walked over to the mess of filing cabinets and dead bodies. Pendleton picked up a few sheafs and began to thumb through them. Wembley looked over his shoulder in curiosity.\nNone of it made sense; not at first glance, anyway. Of course everything was in German, which didn't help a bit. Perhaps strangely, all the words were handwritten. Not only that, but practically scribbled, with jagged lines that blended together and drifted apart. Pendleton flipped to the next page, and the next, and the next - they all ran on in that same monotonous scrawl which was totally indecipherable.\nOn the final page of the sheaf he held, a massive pentagram stared back at him. Wembley practically recoiled at the sight of it. A muddy streak of red underlined it; a maroon blemish on so much black and white.\n \"I don't like this, sir,\" Wembley said.\nThe cold air was filled with the smell of British and German blood. Stonem and Gallant lay in a heap beside one another where the twin cannibals had gunned them down. Wembley accidentally glanced down to find Brixton's shattered features peering back up at him. Burnt edges of flesh smoked around the massive exit wound, which gaped up at him like a fresh mouth.\n\"Grab what you can and let's get going,\" Pendleton said, unable to bear the cold any longer. His head ached fiercely from the beating he'd received.\n\"Anything you say, lieutenant,\" he replied. The two men began scooping up whatever documents they could grab and stuffed them into their pockets, still believing in a quick escape. They'd been through too much to die now.\nBodies were everywhere. They hurried away from the scene of the carnage and exited the freezer, taking care to watch their footing as they moved through the antechamber where Madsen had met his gruesome end. The stairs loomed large ahead of them, and Wembley, who was in far better health in spite of his own shock, held up the rear while Pendleton led them out just in case the officer experienced a sudden loss of balance. The only thing they were both concerned with now was survival.\nPendleton trudged up the stairs. He suddenly felt a strong surge of energy as it occurred to him for the first time that they might in fact live to see another day. The presence of Wembley close behind him provided extra confidence, making it easier to keep moving up.\nAt last they reached the landing. The blasting hot air that they'd been so used to only a few hours before came as both a shock and a relief after being in that cooler.\nThey were both shivering uncontrollably, but managed to stand still and prick their ears to try to detect any further sounds of danger. They could hear nothing unusual except for their own strained breathing.\nPendleton wasn't about to wait around for an invitation. He shuffled into the hallway and headed for the exit with Wembley right behind him. In another minute they were outside standing in the courtyard, the taste of true freedom on their lips. Not only that, but in spite of the massive casualties they'd suffered, and the severe trauma of losing some of their good friends on the mission, they'd managed to complete their objective - at least Pendleton fervently hoped that the disturbing, hand-scrawled documents they'd managed to stuff into their pockets were in fact what battalion headquarters had meant for them to bring back.\nIt all felt so surreal. They could not believe Madsen was actually gone, let alone Brixton, Bulger, and the others. Pendleton reflected that Wembley didn't even know Bulger was dead.\nThe men moved out into the open. Pendleton knew the jeeps were just beyond the sand dune where he'd been stationed with Bulger, but he wanted to take a longer route around the side to hopefully spare Wembley the sight of yet another fallen comrade.\nTheir shoes made soft scuffing noises as they crossed the open ground; past the low wall, and toward the edge of the sand dune. Pendleton reached into his right pocket and was delighted to find that the keys to one of the jeeps were still there.\nFucking hell, Wembley thought. I still don't believe we're about to get out of here alive.\nPendleton strode forth and opened the driver's side door, motioning for Wembley to get in.\n\"I hope you're well enough to drive, because I certainly as hell am not,\" Pendleton said.\nWembley had just opened his mouth to speak when a shot rang out. A sniper's bullet took him in the back of the knee and kicked his feet out from under him, sending him to land hard on his back with a thump.\nPendleton screamed and started to run over, but another shot (it seemed to be coming from the roof of the main building) caused a massive plume of sand to spray up right in front of him. He ducked and moved back around the jeep for cover, leaving Wembley out in the open.\n\"Pendleton, you've got to get out of here, just go!\" Wembley cried. The unseen sniper fired off another potshot, so close that it sent shards of sand rocketing into his left eye. He was toying with him now. Pendleton slid into the jeep while keeping his head down and turned on the engine. The next bullet caught Wembley in the throat, and he was gone.\nA German wearing a white butcher's apron was prone on top of the roof of the main building. He'd crept up there while the others had taken Pendleton down to the basement. The lieutenant hadn't seen him before, and there was no way he could have known that one last enemy lay in wait for them. His mind went blank as he tore his gaze away from the bleeding wreck that was now Private Wembley, and forced himself to think through his pain,  to shift and throw the jeep into motion. It spun out and after another moment, he was gone, rolling hard into the distance to seek any shelter he could find.\nThe sniper watched the taillights bouncing into the distance. He didn't bother to take the shot; it would have been a waste of ammunition, which was already starting to become very precious indeed. Besides, he had plenty of bodies to work with now, and there was no shortage of hooks in the freezer. He continued to scan the desert panorama. Hell, he thought, maybe I'll stay up here awhile and relax, take a little target practice on that corpse, or its soon-to-come vultures. A fine idea, indeed. It was shaping up to be a very pleasant afternoon.\nReaching down, the man on the roof pulled a dried bit of flesh out of his pocket, popped it into his mouth, and solemnly began to chew."}

He was trying to figure out where the damn Court Street entrance was to the Brooklyn Supreme Court when he realized he'd already walked a block east instead - wrong direction. Cursing under his breath, he shoved the phone back in his pocket and turned to head the other way.\n\tHe eventually found himself in a pretty stone plaza outside the courthouse. Wendell scuffed his way up the steps, through the security line where he dumped his change, keys, wallet, phone, and watch into a grey rectangular chamber pot and plopped his backpack onto a conveyor belt, then finally into a huge room full of other people just such as himself - Potential Jurors. He sighed and found a seat near some cute college-looking girls in the back and mentally prepped himself to slog through the day.\n\tHe fiddled with his phone for a bit as more people continued to file in and the minutes crawled forward. He would have done terrible, unspeakable things to stay in bed this morning. Frantic Google searches on his laptop while sitting on the toilet to find ways to get out of jury duty revealed what he had basically already known: shoulda, coulda, woulda pal. So he'd chugged some coffee, smoked a joint, showered, dressed, and hiked down to the C train just in time for rush hour, gamely deciding to try and make the most of it after all. And now here he was. An orientation video was beginning.\n\t\"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here toay to participate in this aspect of our country's justice system. We realize that you've had to put your lives on hold, and it may seem like there's a lot of 'waiting around' time. But on the contrary! You are playing an absolutely crucial role in...\"\n\tWendell allowed his mind to drift off as the man in the video droned on, explaining that a courtroom trial is like - dramatic theater! - and other instructional nuggets of equally fascinating wisdom.\n\tSomeone to his left was watching a cartoon on their tablet without headphones. Wendell identified the lout at fault - a thick-browed, neanderthal-like gentleman who sat and watched in that hunched-forward manner of husky, sullen teenagers - and decided he'd better tap him on the shoulder and tell him to put that shit away. What kind of grown man watches cartoons with the sound up when they're sitting in a courtroom anyway? Before he could summon the nerve to go over, however, an elderly woman sitting behind the douche told him to knock it off herself. Wendell settled back in his chair and smiled. Good for her, he thought. That was when the young man over to his right started coughing.\n\tAt first, there was no reason to pay the man any attention. The fellow had the look of a soldier - high and tight haircut, with muscles that clearly rippled beneath his white t-shirt that seemed intentionally too small. In other words, fit, healthy, normal-looking. Nothing at all out of place.\n\tExcept for that cough."}

A powerful lexicon is losing its impact. It's becoming absolutely de-semanticized.\" The term that she uses, mat, derives from the Russian for \"mother,\" and describes the constantly mutating grab-bag of words that are considered profane. The Russian verb that she employs, desemantizirovat', does not exist in English, but the meaning of \"de-semanticize\" (in this context) lies in the disappearance of semantic meaning that has resulted from the explosion of mat usage since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was illegal to curse in a public area during Soviet times; one could receive a fine if the wrong person overheard an expletive and reported it, and the words assumed a covert role. Following the break-up in December 1991, however, the laws disappeared, and young people discovered a tremendous new sense of entitlement in the way that they spoke, and the way they behaved.\n\tThere are three nouns and one verb - blyad' (\"whore\"), khuy (\"dick\"), pizda (\"cunt\") and ebat' (\"to fuck\") - that constitute the four cornerstones of russkii mat. However, there exists an endless number of combinations and derivatives that function in a vast variety of ways in the Russian language:\nAppropriately, mat was, for many years, the Gulag of Russian linguistics - a vast and complicated network that all Russians knew about but no one publicly acknowledged. Excluded from dictionaries, it was an oral lexicon comprising thousands of phrases, exclamations, interjections and idiomatic expressions, all enveloped in a nimbus of transparent synonyms and coded euphemisms.\n\nInterestingly, each of the four words relates to the semantic field of sexual activity, associated with a distinctively Russian cultural sterility that arguably began during the reign of Catherine the Great. For Russians, the only way to talk about sex was through the use of clunky scientific terms or borrowed foreign words, but mat emerged as a way to have a coherent conversation on a topic that is ubiquitous in almost any culture. This sterility certainly did not diminish during the time of the Soviet Union, and mat became omnipresent in prisons and gulags (forced labor camps) before it burst into mainstream usage following the collapse of the regime:\nNot least of the shocks that followed the collapse of Communism in Russia was the entry into the public domain of words that had never been seen in print before. Russian has an extraordinarily fertile vocabulary of obscenity, but in both imperial and Soviet Russia, for reasons of public decency and censorship, the publishing of swear words was absolutely forbidden. The easing of censorship which accompanied the end of Communism smashed the taboo on printing words that had long been out of sight yet seldom out of earshot.\n\nAs censorship relaxed, the use of mat became most apparent in literature. Indeed, written expression of profanity had received the most attention as the object of censorship during the Soviet period (and earlier), but after the collapse authors delighted in finding new ways to evoke humor, tragedy, and general cultural commentary in their writing. Music, too, became more \"expressive,\" with prominent songwriters incorporating passionate cursing into their lyrical style. One notable example, the leader of the rock band \"Leningrad,\" had this to say about his lyrics' influence on the generation that grew up in the wake of the regime:\n\nInterviewer: Your music, especially the lyrics - a mass of respectable people protest against it. You're spoiling a generation with mat - conquered, you could say, the champion of cleanliness of the Russian language, Lyudmila Verbitskaya, the [former] president of Petersburg University.\n\nS. Shnurov: Well, what do you think, can I spoil an entire generation with my songs?!\n\nInterviewer: You underestimate your influence on the youth.\n\nS. Shnurov: I think it's doubtful I've spoiled the generation. And, as Nitschze said, \"what is falling, one should also push.\" If a generation is ready to fall, that means it's spoiled, if it isn't ready, then it's not."}

In 1992, immediately following the collapse, the Russian film industry found itself in steep decline owing to the economic chaos of privatization, i.e. the transferral of state-owned property into the hands of private investors. Daniil Dondurei, the chief editor of the Russian film journal Iskusstvo kino, called upon filmmakers to create a new national hero as a way to reverse the current situation, claiming that a \"weak cinema mythology\" was partly to blame for the dire situation. Aleksei Balabanov, as well, made a significant contribution to the creation of this mythology in his films Brother and Brother-2, released in 1997 and 2000, respectively, though the hero Danila Bagrov, a ruthless (albeit likeable) assassin, was perhaps not the personification of cinema mythology Dondurei had in mind. Based on box-office revenues, the two films were some of the first to ignite a genuine revival of interest in Russian cinema. Critical praise was forthcoming as well, as Brother received the Grand Prize at Russia's most prestigious film festival, Kinotavr.\nThis essay will explicate how each of the three films chosen (War, Dead Man's Bluff, and Brother-2) provides a telling as well as linguistic cross-section of modern Russian society. The rise in popularity of the kriminal'nyi boevik, or \"criminal action\" film, as Russians refer to it, seems attributable to the lawlessness that characterized the country in the 1990s. Dr. Birgit Beumers, a specialist in contemporary Russian culture, provides further evidence for the popularity of Balabanov's gangster films:\nThe production of Russian crime series flourishes, however. The crime series confirms the community model and defines the center by delineating borders. It stimulates patterns of positive behavior, thus projecting a new identity for Russia, showing Russia's capacity for 'normalcy' in the mirror of fragmented life that surrounds it. This projection of an identity without recourse to a varnished reality makes the crime series extremely popular in contemporary Russia.\n\nIn Lacanian terms, the crime genre plays an important role in constructing a fantasy that \"serves to rehabilitate wounded national pride and fills the gap between crushed post-Soviet illusions and frustrating reality.\"  Beumer's concept of \"projecting a new identity for Russia\" borne out of the \"fragmented life that surrounds it\" supports the idea of the Russian lexicon inheriting a \"fragmented\" nature following the disappearance of a language that was all too Soviet, i.e. dominated by official values and regulations, at least in print. One could argue, in fact, that the cinematic fantasy provides the Russian speaker with an important reference point for the current state of their language.\n\tBeumers goes on to compare Balabanov's appeal with that of another ubiquitous persona in modern Russian cinema, director Nikita Mikhalkov (who incidentally stars in Dead Man's Bluff):\nThe lack of fathers for an entire generation is seen as central to the films of Mikhalkov, who turns to the past for moral guidance, while Balabanov addresses the younger generation and undermines the concept of (familial and criminal) fraternity... While Mikhalkov appeals to an older, richer generation with his public relations campaign (branded cigars, vodka labels, and perfumes), Balabanov appeals to the younger generation and uses the 'young' medium of the internet as his chief marketing tool.\n\nThe link between Balabanov and the youth of Russia is integral to a discussion of current linguistic trends, in that mat connects so closely to the way young people converse. Through the linguistic content of the films, the director conveys his own message regarding the current state of the Russian language, as well as subtle commentary on the current direction in which it is headed - or the direction he himself would like it to take."}

Through the linguistic content of the films, the director conveys his own message regarding the current state of the Russian language, as well as subtle commentary on the current direction in which it is headed - or the direction he himself would like it to take.\n\nConstructing the Symbolic Order\nThis project employs Lacanian \"new psychoanalysis\" to demonstrate how each of Balabanov's three films constructs a specific symbolic order through language, and examines the possibility of an encounter with the real in the diegetic universe pertaining to the usage of russkii mat. One must also keep in mind that without a viewer, in theory the film does not exist; thus, the voyeuristic gaze forms a key part of the meaning that can be derived from each film. It is important to determine whether the content onscreen forms a shocking moment for the audience, i.e. one that remains as an unconscious imprint. In effect, this is what the Real is; in Lacan's own Freduian-based terminology, it represents an age when there was nothing but need, before language had entered into the subject's consciousness, and there was no concept of personal materiality. This pre-lingual state constitutes an important part of Lacan's conceptualization of the Real.\n\tLacan himself often remarked that the Real is impossible for humans since the use of language already marks an irrevocable break from what could be considered any awareness of this anti-verbal state. In the interplay of Lacan's three levels of reality, the Symbolic, Imaginary, and the Real, the latter addresses and mocks the subject through its undefinability, and there is an inherent paradox that exists in trying to explain a concept whose main tenet is that it is completely anti-lingual:\n...the logion 'The Real is impossible' (L'impossible, c'est le reel)' refers to the ultimate impenetrability of the unconscious. It is what resists any further inquiry, what escapes any formulation, exactly as, in the end, matter escapes the ultimate grasp of modern physics. This has nothing to do with an ineffable mystical experience, or a pleasant sally, but everything to do with the definition of impossibility given by modern logic: 'The real in an experience of speech appears only through a virtuality, which in the edifice of logic is defined as an impossibility.'\"\n\nThe mythical status of profanity's role in any language must produce some sort of impact simply through its inherent nature as taboo, indicating a connection to the Real that cannot be articulated, but nonetheless contributes to the presence of the given words themselves. It may well be, however, that mat simply serves as an indicator of an encounter with the real, as opposed to actually constituting the encounter itself.\n\tAn analysis of the symbolic order requires a clear understanding of what Lacan calls \"the big Other,\" the presence of which explains how the order itself functions, i.e. how the subject behaves in accordance to the \"rules\" that the big Other lays out:\nThe big Other operates at a symbolic level. What, then, is this symbolic order composed of? When we speak (or listen, for that matter), we never merely interact with others; our speech activity is grounded on our accepting and relying on a complex network of rules and other kinds of presuppositions. First there are the grammatical rules that I have to master blindly and spontaneously: if I were to bear these rules in mind all the time, my speech would break down. Then there is the background of participating in the same life-world that enables me and my partner in conversation to understand each other. The rules that I follow are marked by a deep divide. There are rules (and meanings) that I follow blindly, out of habit, but of which, if I reflect, I can become at least partially aware (such as common grammatical rules); and there are rules that I follow, meanings that haunt me, in ignorance (such as unconscious prohibitions). Then there are rules and meanings I know of, but must not be seen to know of - dirty or obscene innuendos that one passes over in silence in order to keep up the proper appearances."}

Then there are rules and meanings I know of, but must not be seen to know of - dirty or obscene innuendos that one passes over in silence in order to keep up the proper appearances.\n\nThe last line of the excerpt above forms a crucial moment in the understanding of the big Other, in that amongst \"refined\" or respectable Russians, mat of course belongs to the category of \"dirty or obscene innuendos that one passes over in silence.\" However, the main characters in each film generally would not be considered proper Russians, as most of them are criminals or soldiers. For them, this alters the meaning of \"that which one does not do\" considerably.\nOn the basis of Lacan's theory of reality, this honors thesis will examine mat usage - or lack thereof - under the assumption that it generally does not constitute a sudden break in the symbolic order. The main body of the honors thesis will fall into three main categories corresponding to each film and the symbolic content contained therein. War, Dead Man's Bluff, and Brother-2 each extrapolate on different worlds and different lexicons, although Dead Man's Bluff and Brother-2 are closely linked in that they portray the so-called \"Thieves' World\" that came to be associated with the lawless culture of the 1990s. In the context of the Second Chechen War, abrasive language goes hand-in-hand with terror and intimidation, much as it does in the warlike ghettos that Danila visits during his trip to Chicago in Brother-2. In Dead Man's Bluff, use of profanity most strongly correlates to frequent scenes of torture.\n\tGenerally speaking, however, instances of mat are surprisingly infrequent in the films, and particularly in Dead Man's Bluff  and Brother-2 Balabanov replaces standard profanity with colorful insults that allow for increased semantic specificity - as well as humorous character development. The infrequency of genuine mat phrases makes these films noteworthy, in that their undeniable overuse in society has lead to the aforementioned de-semanticization. The use of new psychoanalysis to examine the framework of language in each movie presents a unique contribution to the study of Russian in and of itself, and the author hopes to break new ground by analyzing the linguistic trends, especially with regard to mat, using Balabanov's cinematic vision qua reflection of reality. As a secondary goal, the analysis will consider whether Balabanov's directing and screenwriting play into the current trends, or more likely, attempt to reverse them, effectively \"re-semanticizing\" mat, as it were, and arguably other areas of the Russian lexicon as well.\n\nViolent Encounters with the Real in Balabanov's War\n\nRussian title: Voina\nEnglish translation: War\nYear released: 2002\nWritten and directed by: Aleksei Balabanov\nStarring: Aleksei Chadov, Ian Kelly, Sergey Bodrov, Jr.\nProduction company: Kinokompaniya STV\n\nThe opening title sequence of War produces perhaps the most striking initial impression out of any of the three films, and consists of a montage of footage from Chechnya that thrusts the viewer directly into the conflict. A great deal of the emotional power contained in the footage derives from the intensity of the accompanying song, entitled \"Jerusalem\" by the highly controversial Chechen bard Timur Mutsuraev. The passion in his vocals and the content of the lyrics function as a fairly confrontational introduction to the film for a Russian audience; Mutsuraev's songs have gained a great deal of notoriety for their support of Islamic fundamentalism, as well as the Chechen rebels' bid for independence from the Russian Federation. Indeed, he has become a well-known symbol of the worldwide Jihadist movement. Here is one notable verse from the epic ballad, which he sings in Russian:\n\nTerrible age, an age of impiety and evil!\nO Allah, life is only clear in Jihad\nOn the earth there is a holy place - the divine mosque\nO Allah, allow us to see it!"}

In fact, the song itself became a sort of rallying cry for Chechen soldiers during the second conflict following its release, prompting Russian troops to call out tauntingly during battle, \"guitars won't take Jerusalem!\"\n\tThis sequence forms a crucial step in the establishment of the film's symbolic order, in that the viewer immediately understands the central role given to the dynamics of war, nationalism, and violent struggle in general. Images in the montage include a cleric preaching fervently to his constituents in a mosque, immediately followed by heavily armed officers appearing to describe battle plans to an unseen crowd. A masked Chechen soldier toting a heavy machine-gun speaks to the camera in front of a large banner that reads, \"Get out of Chechnya, Russian fascists!\" The combination of music and image creates an early encounter with the real for the viewer, by virtue of the fact that an undeniably stirring moment has occurred, but it nevertheless escapes precise definition - this undefinability serves as a key indicator of an encounter with the real. The film appeared in theaters in 2002, and Russians already possessed a strong set of associations with the conflict, insomuch as it had precipitated a series of brutal terrorist attacks that claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians. For instance, at the time of the film's release, the memory of the 1999 apartment bombings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buynaksk would have been quite fresh. These acts were in fact what triggered the Second Chechen War, around which the film bases its story.\n\tIn a way, this film is perhaps sadly prescient as one of the most tragic Chechen-led terrorist attacks lay just around the corner. War began its run in theaters on 23 August 2002, while the Moscow theater hostage crisis occurred in October of the same year. Over the course of three days, Chechen terrorists (accompanied by a squad of female suicide bombers) took 850 people hostage, demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya. Vladimir Putin's government decided that bluffing to buy time would be the best strategy. Meanwhile, a Spetsnaz (Russian special forces) squad hastily laid out plans to storm the building. In the ensuing operation, which relied on an unidentified chemical agent being pumped into the building to knock the perpetrators unconscious, 129 hostages were killed by the effects of the gas, along with 39 terrorists, who were shot and killed either while unconscious, or during several firefights that flared throughout the building. Mainly due to shoddy rescue efforts, the civilian casualties resulted from suffocation while lying unconscious on their backs in the inclement weather.\n\tAgain, this disaster had not yet occurred at the release of War, but the implications are clear: a vast amount of animosity exists between many Russians and their neighbors in the Caucausus mountains, and the film sets up a highly charged dynamic by manipulating these emotions.\nZizek states that the big Other, (synonymous with symbolic order) is that thing \"for which I am willing to give my life.\" There are two different big Others operating here, and that of Chechen nationalism and the struggle for independence reign supreme from the rebels' point of view. In this case, it cannot be overlooked that the big Other is most easily conceptualized through Islam, which provides much of the basis for the rebels' seemingly god-given will to fight. In a clever fictional reference, the local warlord mentions that he descended from the \"Murid,\" which means \"one who desires\" in Arabic. Balabanov foregrounds their religious commitment in many ways, and this facet of their existence serves as the most prominent indicator of the big Other."}

In a clever fictional reference, the local warlord mentions that he descended from the \"Murid,\" which means \"one who desires\" in Arabic. Balabanov foregrounds their religious commitment in many ways, and this facet of their existence serves as the most prominent indicator of the big Other.\n\nSoldiers, Warlords, and Hostages: Conflicting Big Others\nThe big Other by which the Russian side operates is thus shown in relief, in that the soldiers assume the responsibility of possibly giving their lives to dismantle or destroy the Chechen separatist movement. Technically speaking, the government establishes this symbolic order by issuing its directives to the military, which the soldiers in turn must execute - or die trying. In Balabanov's depiction of the brutal execution of two Russian foot soldiers who had the misfortune of becoming prisoners of war, the viewer becomes disconcertingly familiar with the true depravity that results from this particular ideological conflict.\n\tFramed by the narration of Ivan Yermakov (Aleksei Chadov), Balabanov introduces his viewers to the location where the most important action will ultimately take place: a rebel camp tucked away into the idyllic mountains of Chechnya. The beauty of the locale contrasts heavily with the automatic weapons and heavyset figures that emerge from a truck that rolls into the compound, filmed through what appears to be a home video camera. It soon becomes clear that the cameraman is a Chechen soldier, tasked with documenting the subsequent execution of the captives that the rebels unceremoniously haul from the truck and dump on the ground. In Lacanian terms, this entire scene comprises a quintessential encounter with the real.\n\tA large number of Russians would have been aware of the terrible video that was posted online in 1999, depicting the actual beheading of a Russian infantryman at the hands of the same type of rebels depicted in this first scene. In fact, Balabanov used the sound byte of the soldier's death cries in the video as the audio for the scene in War, which lends the phrase \"encounter with the real\" an entirely more significant meaning. According to Zizek, direct violence is an unequivocal example of the real breaking through the symbolic order, but one might argue that in the context of the Chechen rebels' big Other, this is hardly a break from the accepted symbolic events that comprise their struggle for independence. One can be absolutely certain that it is a different matter for the Russian audience, and the death of the soldiers would be extremely shocking for them.\nWith the use of the actual sound byte of a real soldier dying, along with the general composition of the scene, Balabanov forcibly casts the viewer out of his comfort zone and into the world of war that thoroughly characterizes the film. In the early sequences, the director introduces us to Ivan and fellow prisoner Fedka, both of whom were captured by the rebels during an ambush early in their tour of duty. Viewers are also introduced to John and Margaret, English theater actors who fall victim to kidnapping during a theater tour in the bordering country of Georgia. The interplay of Russian and Chechen symbolic orders takes on a third element with the introduction of the English characters, in that they are thrust wholly outside any realm of experience they might have had before. As they cower from the celebratory gunshots of the rebels following the executions, the real engulfs their entire existence, leaving them completely bereft of any symbolic reference points. Indeed, their body language indicates a complete state of panic for the entire duration of the first scene, and the hapless couple does not fare much better in the basement that serves as their dungeon.\nWith the establishment of these big Others, all ostensibly acting in contradiction to one another, it is not until later that mat makes an appearance in the context of the film's dialogue. Ivan's narrative further explains the nature of trying to survive as a prisoner of war, saying: \"In the hole it's every man for himself. You're always hungry and they beat you all the time.\" Regardless, he is able to function in this setting quite effectively, eventually securing his and Fedka's release. Up to this point, it seems as though encounters with the real generally occur only with relation to John and Margaret, who, as mentioned before, are completely and utterly out of their element. Ivan and Fedka are soldiers, presumably able to rely on their military training to ingratiate themselves into the Chechen order, mainly through the slave labor that they provide for Aslan (Giorgi Gurgulia), the warlord who runs the contingent that holds them captive.\nIn fact, it appears that Aslan considers Ivan rather indispensable, as the rebel commander relies on him to provide updates on the war based on internet findings. Furthermore, Ivan's limited ability to speak English allows him to communicate with John, and cross into that symbolic order as well. John accepts his help in much the same way that Aslan does, although Ivan exists outside both realms. Despite his apparent ability to interact with characters beyond his own symbolic order, mat plays an important role in creating a conflict between Aslan and Ivan during a pivotal scene where John attempts to negotiate his release with the British consulate. After a fruitless phone conversation, during which John finds out that the government will not pay a ransom for him and his fiancee, the following exchange between Ivan and Aslan takes place:\nAslan: Tell him that he has exactly two months to get 2 million pounds, and if he doesn't, the whole lot of us will fuck [his fiancee], and then I'll cut her fucking head off.\nIvan: What are you cursing for? Allah forbids it.\nAslan: Speaking Russian is the same thing as cursing. To Allah, all your words are the same."}

Allah forbids it.\nAslan: Speaking Russian is the same thing as cursing. To Allah, all your words are the same.\n\nThis scene correlates strongly to the context of the overall analysis, as it foregrounds religion as the central petit objet 'a'. According to Lacan, le petit objet 'a' manifests itself as a characteristic that allows the subject to identify the \"ethnic other,\" a being whose symbolic order by definition must be entirely different. Though Aslan speaks Russian with a heavy accent, the most important indicator of Ivan's (and to a certain extent, John's) status as an ethnic other lies in the fact that they do not \"believe.\" In an earlier scene Aslan talks to Ivan about cleansing his homeland of \"unbelieving dogs,\" in a direct reference to the Russians. Also in that scene, he goes on to claim that he will not rest until \"not a single Russian is left, from here to Volgograd.\"\n\tThis scene begs the question of whether or not Aslan's foul language constitutes an encounter with the real for Ivan. It certainly does not for John, who does not speak a word of Russian, and shows no sign of intuitively understanding the threat, but Ivan's reaction seems out of place given the circumstances, and points to the fact that he is indeed offended by Aslan's statement. Why, then, does the objection seem out of place? Aslan is the man who controls the fate of both captives, and despite Ivan's priveleged position at the warlord's side, taking issue with Aslan's language constitutes an extreme breach in the hierarchy of the camp, i.e. a serious infraction in the symbolic order.\n\tThe fact that Ivan dares to object in the first place lends heavy credence to the assumption that mat itself provides the circumstances for a fissure in the symbolic order. Aslan could easily execute him for such an indiscretion, but Ivan takes such issue that he chooses to ignore the Chechen's prerogative in order to voice his opinion. Paradoxically, Aslan has specifically designed his statement to intimidate Ivan into conveying the same sense to John through translation. The threat does not really concern Ivan, since Aslan directs it towards John and Margaret, but nevertheless he fully comprehends the gravity of the situation, as would the Russian viewer. However, image ultimately transcends the language barrier, and John fully realizes the extent of the danger when he views Aslan's \"parting gift\": a videotape of the executions that occurred during the opening scene.\n\tThe wording of the threat is important as well. Aslan employs two distinctive mat phrases, the first being yebat', a verb meaning \"to fuck,\" as well as na khuy, a construction that Russian speakers commonly employ in the context of the expression poshol ty na khuy, which effectively translates into English as \"go fuck yourself.\" He uses it here, however, to accompany the expression \"cut her head off\" to lend the threat added severity and potency. By adding na khuy to the end of the sentence, \"cut her head off\" becomes \"cut her fucking head off,\" and arguably this precise statement leads Ivan to object so strongly to the wording. Ivan's world is built on love of country, decency, and most of all honor, and through this one can understand why such a violent declaration would cause him to speak up in defiance of Aslan.\n\tAnother important instance of mat usage occurs about midway through the film, when Ivan negotiates with an alleged KGB major to secure his and John's entry into Chechnya. The major curses exactly once using the word pizdets, which can translate into English any number of ways. The online user-created dictionary Multitran lists its definition as \"[it's a] fucking disaster\" or \"fuck-up\" (specifying Americanized English as the object language), but the word most often comes into play accompanied by the dative case, i.e. an indirect object, as in \"[for you] it's a fucking disaster.\" Indeed, the KGB major uses it with an indirect object, but the context leads to an altered signification, as reflected in an excerpt from their conversation:\nKGB Major: You've got no other option, Sergeant, without me you're fucked, got it?\nIvan: Got it. The day after tomorrow we'll meet right here. I'll bring the money. Just one condition: I go with you."}

The day after tomorrow we'll meet right here. I'll bring the money. Just one condition: I go with you.\n\nAn interesting aspect of this dialogue lies in the fact that the Major addresses Ivan using the diminutive form of ty, which can be used to indicate either affection or condescension. For a native Russian speaker, the scene constitutes a clearcut case of the Major patronizing Ivan. Regardless, it takes on a meaning that indicates utter disaster, i.e. death, when used in such a context. Indeed, this scene illustrates an important point relating to mat usage, which lies in the difficulty of ascertaining the precise meaning of a word or expression, whether in the context of contemporary usage or otherwise:\nBecause swearing exists in many different forms, from the deadliest curse to a joke between friends, from a withering expression of contempt to a mild expression of annoyance, it is impossible to reconstruct the range of meanings that swearing carried in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Russian society in their entirety. Much of the meaning of swearing depends upon context, upon the shared values and intuitions of the speaker and the addressee, and this is extraordinarily difficult for the historian to reconstruct."}

Much of the meaning of swearing depends upon context, upon the shared values and intuitions of the speaker and the addressee, and this is extraordinarily difficult for the historian to reconstruct.\n\nFurther analysis of the origin of this particular word is warranted in order to proceed with the discussion of this scene. Pizdets derives from the cornerstone mat word pizda, meaning \"cunt,\" which in turn comes indirectly from the verb pisat', \"to piss.\" Interestingly, expressions using pizdets and pizda connect strongly to death.  This seems to be a result of the inherent link between femininity and life, i.e. birth, which here arguably reverses itself by virtue of the fact that it is an obscene expression. One can identify the connotation more precisely however, in the way that Russians often modify the phrase poshol ty na khuy into poshol ty v pizdu, which literally means \"go into the cunt.\" The crude semantic meaning  of a reversal of birth essentially communicates to the admonished one that he can just go ahead and die, for all the speaker cares.\n\tWith all this in mind, the reader can understand the exact nature of the message that the KGB Major conveys to Ivan, which native speakers understand intuitively. Without his help, he and John will certainly die trying to get across the Chechen border. However, the Major turns out to be a fraud, and the stalwart duo must tag along with a detachment of Russian kontraktniki (\"mercenaries\") on their way into the war-torn republic. As noted earlier, this single word's occurrence during the negotiation presents a heavy contrast with the scene where Ivan challenges Aslan. Although the encounter constitutes a serious breach of the symbolic hierarchy, i.e. Ivan stepping out of line to voice his disapproval, the Major's use of pizdets functions in the opposite capacity. This codified signal illustrates the distinction between Lacan's enunciation and enunciated - the act of making the statement, and the signal contained in the actual words themselves, respectively.\nBoth the enunciated content and the enunciation itself serve critical symbolic functions in the context of this scene. By making that particular statement (\"without me you're fucked, got it?\"), in conjunction with the diminutive ty form of address, the Major creates a symbolic space for the negotiation that places Ivan in an inferior position. However, throughout the conversation he only addresses Ivan as \"Sergeant,\" reinforcing the message that he outranks him, and that without his help the lower-ranked officer's situation would be hopeless. The thinly veiled presence of death qua the word pizdets acts as the enunciated content, in that it further cements the older man's alleged superiority, and Ivan coolly reacts by indicating \"message received,\" then abruptly ending the conversation and walking away.\nThe smooth interchange of symbols in this dialogue indicates that the Major's use of mat does not constitute any sort of infraction in the symbolic order, though it may be its utterance that apprises Ivan of the man's shady ulterior motives. Furthermore, a Russian audience would not have noticed anything unusual about the statement, given the hardened military persona of both men. Viewers who claim Russian as their native language would perceive such language as entirely typical, and it ultimately lends added authenticity to the scene since the audience would subconsciously comprehend the big Other - the Russian military and special forces - to which both characters adhere.\nAs a brief side note, this idea of the big Other as it operates in the context of the Russian armed services effectively manifests itself in a single character: Captain Medvedev (Sergei Bodrov, Jr.), the prisoner who is left behind with Margaret while Ivan shoulders the responsibility of securing the release of the warlord's nephew in exchange for the Captain.  Ivan continuously espouses Medvedev's virtues, which he describes to his unseen interrogator:\n\nIvan: Captain Medvedev was, of course, a real man. Everyone worked that out right away. You can't break a guy like that, can't wear him down. If we had more like him, what an army we would have!"}

You can't break a guy like that, can't wear him down. If we had more like him, what an army we would have!\n\nMedvedev is honorable, stoic, and totally committed to his duty as a Russian officer. Even when the rebels have tossed him, Fedka, and Ivan into the same pit, he demands a proper report, and that the observance of rank and other military formalities be maintained. As he says, \"we mustn't let things slip. There's a war on.\"\n\tIvan idolizes the Captain, and states repeatedly that rescuing him was likely the main motivator for making his way back into the heart of rebel territory with an incompetent foreigner. The simple fact that he returns at all indicates that Ivan considers himself absolutely willing to give his life for the big Other that Medvedev embodies; such devotion serves as a key tenet of the big Other's demands. Towards the end of the film, Medvedev displays all the quintessential traits of Russian masculinity, which provides another way of qualifying the symbolic order to which Ivan wholeheartedly subscribes. Despite an injury that leaves him without the use of his legs, Medvedev fights off the attacking rebels after Ivan has seized Aslan's camp, and even provides a plan to effect their ultimate escape. With such a stalwart man to look up to, direct violence remains as the only true encounter with the real for either Ivan or the Captain. Alternately, in the earlier scene involving Aslan's foul language, the threat of brutality against a civilian reveals something that is completely lacking in honor and lies outside their acceptable codes of behavior - at least in the film.\n\tIn Lacanian and Zizekian theory, direct violence always constitutes an encounter with the real, regardless of the big Other \"watching over\" the subject. The director foregrounds this as the central breach in the symbolic order for the characters involved, and it serves as an impetus for movement in and out of contrasting orders. For example, in a pivotal scene during which Ivan and John attempt to procure a means of transport, they ambush a rebel jeep, only to find that a blast from Ivan's shotgun has killed an woman sitting in the backseat. This may appear as a breach in Ivan's moral code, but his other \"guidelines\" allow him to accept the fact he was faced with a kill-or-be-killed situation. In fact, careful inspection of the scene reveals that the woman herself fired a rocket that nearly kills Ivan. The battle ostensibly crushes John's spirits, who moans about the killing, understandably assuming that they have murdered an innocent civilian.\nBy the next morning, however, the Englishman brims with renewed energy, fully ready to continue with the mission. Though the murder resulted in the violent removal of all John's previous reference points, he adapts with surprising rapidity to the volatile circumstances, and cements his transition into Ivan's symbolic order. The director illustrates this with the following conversation (Ivan must speak in English to communicate with John, which explains the simplicity of his diction):\nJohn: There was a woman, and you killed her.\nIvan: John, it's war. Very simple. If I don't kill them, they kill you, after they kill me. Don't think in war, John, think before war. In war, you must survive. To survive, you must kill."}

Very simple. If I don't kill them, they kill you, after they kill me. Don't think in war, John, think before war. In war, you must survive. To survive, you must kill.\n\nThis somewhat over-simplified summation of the trials and tribulations of war points to the fact that this film is entirely concerned with violence as its criterion for the big Other.\n\tIn the end, the pair manages to take Aslan's camp by storm, ultimately leading to the warlord's murder at John's hands. This results from a sudden rage that sets in upon finding his fiancee lying naked in the arms of Captain Medvedev. In a bizarre sort of denial of the fact that she has obviously sought loving refuge voluntarily, he guns Aslan down while screaming accusations of rape. The scene is even stranger given the fact that John has strapped a camcorder to his helmet, and the director chooses to show the murder as it appears through John's lens, repeating the \"movie within a movie\" dynamic that he establishes in the first scene through the filming of the execution.\n\tThus, everything comes full circle, leaving the viewer questioning whether there are any \"good guys\" in the film at all. The gratuitous violence constitutes the nucleus of the story in every way, from Aslan's gruesome threats to get the ransom, to Ivan's prowess with a sniper rifle, and of course John's entrance into the world of indiscriminate killing. The point here is that mat functions secondarily to any other diegetic elements, at least in the construction of the symbolic order. The simplicity of the film's title captures it all, and the idiosyncracies of the various languages - John's bumbling English, Ivan's slick Muscovite Russian, the rebels' gruff Chechen and Arabic war cries - are ultimately superceded by the shattering power of bloodshed.\n\tAs previously stated, direct violence ultimately produces the only encounter with the real in the true Lacanian sense that occurs in this film. Obscenity simply does not function with enough potency to break down the walls that the big Other constructs between each of the three radically different main characters. A telling moment that provides evidence to this claim occurs when John asks Ivan if he has to keep beating their prisoner, a Chechen shepherd (and former rebel) whom they have forced to act as their guide to Aslan's camp: Ivan, irritated by John's naivete, replies that, \"this is the only language he understands.\"  Balabanov seems to be making the argument that there is no other way for these people to communicate with each other. Even when two subjects share the same native language, meaning gets lost when they define themselves through vastly different life experiences; a comical moment takes place when Ivan gives an interview upon returning home, and the journalist must ask what \"ordering\" a person means (the verb zakazat' can be used to order a meal, or place a contract on somebody's head). Surprised, Ivan replies, \"how do you 'order' a murder? What, are you just back from the moon?\"\n\tThe prominence of violence leads to a somewhat grim and pessimistic conclusion, but that may be what makes the film such a powerful anti-war statement. It presents itself as anti-foreigner as well, to be sure, though Chechens do not exactly fit neatly into the category of \"foreigner,\" since of course they speak Russian and the republic is part of the Russian Federation. The movie makes a strong case for a sort of isolationist mentality with regard to ethnic Russians, and that perhaps Chechnya has gone too far to be included in the country any longer. When Ivan winds up in St. Petersburg to speak with Captain Medvedev's wife, there is a comforting atmosphere of camaraderie and communal values that make the city seem even more breathtaking in the brief scene set there. Balabanov's love for his hometown is evident in the scene's cinematography, mimicking Ivan's gaze as he takes in the architecture with child-like wonder.\n\tThe following two film selections are equally violent, if not more so, and it will be of critical importance to determine whether or not the director deems language and mat as similarly ineffective in terms of actual communication. Given the fact that nearly every single one of Balabanov's films employs realistic violence, generally owing to his patronage of the crime genre, the analysis must determine whether that forms his one driving factor in the portrayal of contemporary Russia. Perhaps he is merely stating matters as he sees them, and in his eyes the situation in Russia is utterly dire. Modern Russia is heir to an extremely bloody history, and it seems as though the gratuity in his films acts as a kind of rejection of that past. Through shock value, he renders modern violence as both disturbing and superfluous.\nForced Confessions and Unconventional Insults in Dead Man's Bluff"}

The film begins in media res during a university lecture that serves as a brief introduction to the so-called oligarchs - Russians who became extremely wealthy amidst the chaos of privatization - and the importance of start-up capital. Indeed, armed struggle in the name of cash forms the nucleus of this dark comedy. This film undoubtedly presents itself as the most overtly symbol-driven of the three, in the sense that in the world of Russian gangsters living in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, displays of wealth and power motivate everything, and their impact is evident throughout the movie.\n\tTangible symbols, such as the black BMW that the main characters Sergei and Simon drive, play a key role in establishing the kind of outlook on life that the characters adopt. It also relates to the way in which jargon functions as an expression of the same:\n[The] reflexive moment of declaration means that every utterance not only transmits some content, but, simultaneously, conveys the way the subject relates to this content...One should never forget that utility functions as a reflective notion: it always involves the assertion of utility as meaning. A man who lives in a large city and owns a Land-Rover (for which he obviously has no use) doesn't simply lead a no-nonsense, down-to-earth life; rather, he owns such a car in order to signal that he leads his life under the sign of a no-nonsense, down-to-earth attitude. To wear stone-washed jeans is to signal a certain attitude to life."}

To wear stone-washed jeans is to signal a certain attitude to life.\n\nThe BMW - a power symbol commonly associated with the acquisition of wealth in post-Soviet Russia - functions as a signal of Sergei and Simon's \"attitude to life,\" in that it demonstrates their krutost' (\"toughness\"), and operates as a crucial indicator of their subservience to the big Other of the \"Thieves' World.\"\nViolence also acts as critical factor in the construction of the universe, much in the same way that it functioned in War. Though the conclusion was drawn in the previous analysis that violence supercedes all else in terms of symbolic communication in a war zone, it rings false to assume that it functions secondarily in the context of Dead Man's Bluff. Violence does not reign supreme as the method of symbolic exchange, though its omnipresence may initially suggest otherwise. Biting jargon plays a huge role in the development of the various characters' personalities, and one might argue that the speed of one's mouth often takes priority over the speed with which a gangster can draw his pistol. It is true that gratuitous violence and gunplay are omnipresent, but the darkly comedic nature of the film tends to shift the focus away from statements on violence itself, desensitizing the viewer to the point where he is convinced that the film's true message must be found elsewhere.\n\tThe plot of Dead Man's Bluff revolves around the aforementioned brothers, Simon and Sergei, and their quest to deliver a suitcase of heroin to their employer, Sergei Mikhalych (Nikita Mikhalkov). They run into trouble when a rival gang hijacks the case in a scam that a crooked local cop orchestrates in order to make some fast cash for himself. The heroin is the so-called \"MacGuffin,\" and plays a central role not only in the progression of events within the film, but in the characterization of the race for start-up capital in post-Soviet Russia.\n\tWith everyone running around after such a stigmatized substance as heroin, it becomes immediately apparent that the movie deals with a morally nebulous group of people. These characters will stop at nothing to attain what they perceive to be rightfully theirs - a slice of the freshly baked capitalist pie. This is what the big Other comes down to; it is that for which the characters are willing to give their lives, i.e. ideology in its purest form. In such an extreme situation, there is little that we can conceivably identify as something that \"one does not do,\" therefore encounters with the real become slightly more problematic. In War the virtual \"soldiers' code\" that Ivan adheres to presents much more clearly defined parameters of behavior. The thugs that we see onscreen here, however, do not concern themselves with such scruples. Literally anything goes, including - and perhaps especially - the betrayal of one's partners.\n\tAs Yana Hashamova writes in her essay, \"Aleksei Balabanov's Russian Hero: Fantasies of Wounded National Pride,\" \"Blindman's Bluff [Hashamova's choice of translation for the title] is a criminal comedy which exposes the idiocy and cruelty of the criminal world.\" Indeed, the film abounds with acts of torture and merciless executions, but how can one make sense of this using the psychoanalytical approach? It stands to reason that these violent elements constitute the \"norms\" of this particular world, and by the end of the film the viewer is justified in being barely surprised by the massive body count that Simon and Sergei have accrued. Again, this is what constitutes the aforementioned desensitization that Balabanov manifests via the onslaught of gore that remains more or less constant throughout the film.\n\tWith this in mind, the question remains: is a break in this symbolic order even possible? A paradox exists in the fact that this so-called order thrives on complete and utter chaos, and the only \"rule\" is that there are no rules. This might suggest that the only break in the symbolic order would be adhering to some criminal code, but this bears little resemblance to the characteristics of an encounter with the real that have thus far been established in the analysis.\n\tThe aforementioned paradox builds on the ubiquitous nature of extreme violence in the film, and it stands to reason that the \"golden\" rule of direct violence as an encounter with the real may in fact be defunct, at least in the context of the symbolic order that Balabanov has created. The film's subgenre -\"dark\" comedy - also contributes to the underlying sense that even the violence should not be taken seriously, and makes the whole thing feel skewed in a way that strongly affects one's possible perceptions of the characters' reality.\n\tThere are ways to parse this reality, perplexing though it may seem. The fact that the action takes place in the mid-1990s sheds a great deal of light on the situation for ordinary Russians dealing with the recent collapse of the Soviet Union, and it was at precisely this point in Russia's history that russkii mat underwent a serious transformation. The Communist Party was no longer in power, and with it went the laws that had helped quash dissidence and other radical forms of individual expression:\n\"...the most radical changes in the Russian language came after the collapse of the Soviet Union. A whole new vocabulary was needed to reflect the emerging bandit-capitalist reality; and on the vacant lot of Soviet newspeak neologisms culled from the jargon of prison life and drug culture sprouted like bamboo. Those words transformed Russian into a language of desire, irony, coercion, and pragmatism.\""}

Those words transformed Russian into a language of desire, irony, coercion, and pragmatism.\"\n\nThe author describes the kind of world portrayed in Dead Man's Bluff, and the \"desire, irony, coercion and pragmatism\" appears throughout the film in the context of the dialogue. The director limits genuine mat usage to the word blyad' as a type of interjection, usually to denote irritation, or pain (as in the scene at the end of the film where Sergei takes a bullet in the stomach, causing him to cry out \"bol'na, blyad'!\" (\"it fucking hurts!\"). One could argue that Aleksei Panin, who plays Sergei, ad-libbed the curse, considering the instinctive nature of its general use. Even in that small example, the word's de-semanticization becomes apparent, functioning as a way for the character to unload a substantial amount of negativity in response to the intense pain of a gunshot wound. The main argument here lies in the fact that Sergei's use of mat correlates to an encounter with the real because the pain compels him to express himself in the only way that corresponds to the complete loss of reference points that he experiences, having been shot for the first time (a fact that he mentions later).\nNevertheless, it would seem that his cursing merely serves as an indicator of his violent encounter with the real as a gunshot wound, and the author finds it unlikely that the word itself constitutes a break in anyone's symbolic order qua enunciated content - be it for the audience or the only other character present in the scene, Simon. Indeed, the word has become so overused that it is in fact barely noticeable to the average viewer. As in War, mat serves as an important signifier of a character's encounter with the real, generally in the form of violence or extremely powerful emotions, but it is a signifier nonetheless.\n\tAnother example occurs during a particularly gruesome scene where Simon and Sergei are torturing a corrupt policeman to find out who set them up. Sergei sits on a couch posing the question of \"who took our heroin\" in various menacing ways, while Simon brutally beats and stabs the unfortunate policeman. Despite their efforts, the crooked cop strives to hold out as long as possible, screaming the word suki (\"bitches\") in defiance, adding that he has no idea who took the heroin, or who set them up. Of course, Simon and Sergei have come to the right place, as the cop orchestrated the theft, and at the point where he realizes his life is over, he finally confesses to his role in the plot.\n\tThe word suka is crucial to an analysis of this scene in terms of explicating the distinction between mat words and words that are considered simply rude. In an interview conducted with Nina Mikhailovna, the topic came up with relation to the film, and her answer (transcribed and translated below) clarifies the specific lexical status of this particular epithet:\nS. Vary: Next question. What can you tell me about the word suka [bitch]? In other words, what level of violence is contained in this word?\n\nN. Mikhailovna: Well, like the word blin [the word blin literally means pancake, but has become a euphemism for the word blyad' due to its phonetic similarity, much in the same way that English speakers substitute the word \"shoot\" for \"shit\"] the word suka is used absolutely as the same kind of interjection: \"He suka didn't show up,\" \"what is he suka doing here,\" right? That is, this word has already practically lost its [semantic] sense, yes? But in Russian the word suka has many meanings. It is a dog of the female gender, it's a bad person, it's a woman who has done something to you. But now this word is generally used without its real meaning, it's basically the same kind of interjection as the word blin.\n\nS. Vary: In this film [Dead Man's Bluff] I noticed that the word comes up when there are very hot emotions."}

But now this word is generally used without its real meaning, it's basically the same kind of interjection as the word blin.\n\nS. Vary: In this film [Dead Man's Bluff] I noticed that the word comes up when there are very hot emotions.\n\nN. Mikhailovna: Yes, in general mat constitutes that part of the lexicon, which we use when there actually are very hot emotions, but the problem with Russian lies in the fact that mat is losing this emotional coloration; it is becoming an absolutely neutral text, included in a situation which completely does not suppose that this mat can be used.\n\nS. Vary: But is the word suka considered mat?\n\nN. Mikhailovna: It's difficult for me to say. Of course it's a rude word, it's a vulgarism; of course this word must involve a strong feeling, but probably strictly speaking... in general it is mat, of course, but it is used absolutely as a non-mat word. By the way, the word blin is also mat.\n\nNina conveys some important information here, made especially pertinent given her status as a native speaker of Russian, as well as one who belongs to the generation that grew up surrounded by the abject cultural sterility of Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union. Her answer regarding the status of suka as belonging to mat is particulary helpful, despite the fact that she feels it has lost its \"emotional coloration.\" Suka falls into the same category of mat words that have apparently lost their impact, relegated instead to the role of banal interjections that overuse and repetition have rendered barely noticeable. The examples she gives of the word's modern usage [\"he suka didn't show up\"] clearly shows the lack of semantic significance in the context of the statement. Instead it merely connotates the speaker's slight irritation.\n\tGoing back to the instance where Sergei curses in pain, one can easily understand why he would not actually perceive the word blyad' as blasphemy, despite his avowed religiosity. Similarly, the tortured cop's screams of suka do not create a breach in the linguistic order; on the contrary, they only further cement it in place. Both the viewer and the characters must understand the curse as, granted, an example of mat, but nonetheless a secondary indicator of the character's agony and fear at the hands of these ruthless thugs. Thus, its use qualifies as anything but an encounter with the real, even if it indicates such an encounter as a result of the surrounding circumstances.\n\tUnfortunately, these observations provide mounting evidence for the case against any genuine significance of modern vulgar argot in the Russian language. Based on the interview with Nina Mikhailovna, however, it seems as though she views this as a current process, not something that is all said and done, as it were. She gives the distinct impression that this process has the potential to reverse itself if Russian speakers choose to become more conscientious about their use of mat, but ultimately this comes down to a personal choice, based on individual circumstances. Another excerpt from the Erofeyev's article articulates this point of view quite nicely and provides further evidence of the fact:\n\n\"Teen-agers,\" Baranov [Anatoly Baranov, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of the Russian Language] continued, \"use mat as the backdrop itself, because it is a reflection of their reality; a reflection of how bad they feel. It's a discharge of psychological energy. Then, as with drugs, you have to use the words more and more often to produce the desired effect.\""}

It's a discharge of psychological energy. Then, as with drugs, you have to use the words more and more often to produce the desired effect.\"\n\nIt would be difficult to argue that Baranov's point lacks credence, especially given his position at the Russian Academy of Sciences. One must regard his analogy of drug use as highly prescient in this context. There is no disputing the fact that overuse of the words has lead to the lessening of their impact. Though this may be true in the linguistic expressions of young Russians today, there remains a glimmer of hope for mat's potency in Balabanov's films. Overuse is certainly not a factor in any of the three, and indeed the scattered instances of mat are notable through their sudden appearance and general brevity.\n\tDead Man's Bluff demonstrates a continuing trend in Balabanov's work where he manages to preserve that emotional coloration that Nina Mikhailovna spoke of. When Sergei curses in pain after being wounded, the viewer comprehends the true sense of the negativity he is attempting to unload, i.e. anger and pure physical agony. In much the same way as in War, the viewer is shocked and disturbed by the depravity of Aslan's threat against the innocent British woman, significantly accentuated by his foul language. Balabanov understands the degradation of the language through overuse just as well as Anatoly Baranov or Nina Mikhailovna Filippova, and these scenes would simply not be as poignant if every other dialogue involved a stream of profanity.\n\tDead Man's Bluff distinguishes itself through two slightly different types of vulgarity that appear multiple times throughout the movie. The most prominent example lies in the fact that the characters employ anti-homosexual slurs to denigrate one another. Russians do not consider these slurs mat per se, but they certainly fall under the cateogry of \"vulgarisms\" and entail an entirely different level of profanity by virtue of their hateful semantic connotations, which casts an unpleasant light on the person who uses them. In an early scene, Sergei Mikhailych dispatches Simon and Sergei to the home of a local chemist, known only as \"the Doctor,\" in order to offer a deal for expensive and arguably unnecessary protection from their particular crime ring. The Doctor is rude and unwilling to talk, perceiving the men as they really are - a pair of ignorant thugs trying to extort him for being the \"new guy in town.\"\n\tThe conversation begins to get out of hand, so to speak, when the pair's attempts at intimidation lead to the Doctor becoming even more stubborn. When two other men arrive wielding pistols (apparently the Doctor's original protection), it appears as though Simon and Sergei have run out of luck, but Simon manages to dispatch them in the blink of an eye with guns on sliding tracks hidden in his sleeves. After the shooting, the following conversation takes place between the two gangsters:\nSimon: Now what are we going to do?\nSergei: You know, I have two feelings. My one half says we ought to waste this wretch.\nSimon: And the second?\nSergei: And the second says we should leave him alive and bring him to Mikhailych. Let him decide what to do with him. Personally I like the first variant better...\nSimon: Me too. Only what'll we tell Mikhailych?\nSergei: We'll tell him that this rat whipped out a cannon and started waving it around. We turned out to be quicker.\nSimon: You know, something's throwing me for a loop...\nSergei: All right. Then let's flip a coin. Heads, we bring him to Mikhailych, tails we blow him away. You know, I haven't met fags like this in a long time. He's not even a businessman, this guy is some kind of extremist!"}

You know, I haven't met fags like this in a long time. He's not even a businessman, this guy is some kind of extremist!\n\nImmediately after this pleasant exchange of ideas, the Doctor starts firing from a gun that he has hidden underneath the table in a last-ditch effort to save his skin. The shots go wild and Simon immediately fires back, killing the hapless chemist and causing him to crash onto the lab table, breaking equipment and knocking heroin everywhere. Obviously, the Doctor had fully recognized the depravity of the two men, and knew that perhaps his only chance of survival lay in trying to kill them first, but one might argue that Sergei's final comment instills sufficient anger to cause him to fire away desperately. The word that he uses, pidoras, accurately translates as \"fag\" or \"faggot,\" and arguably carries the same abhorrent weight in Russian as it does in English. One can see how this \"loaded\" insult might cause the Doctor to reach his breaking point, especially since he has just witnessed the execution of his two comrades.\nHomosexual imagery qua hateful communication is highly prevalent even in today's Russia, and usually only appears when the speaker actually desires a dangerous escalation of the situation. Culturally speaking, homophobia continues to run rampant, and even the most common admonition - poshol ty na khuy (literally \"go [sit] on a dick\") - carries the shameful association of homosexual rape. Interestingly, the common words pidor or pidoras (which both translate to \"faggot\") are not considered mat, in spite of their status as perhaps two of the rudest words in the entire language. They appear at least one other time in the course of the film, but again Balabanov remains linguistically conservative in order to preserve the power of the statement. Though possibly subject to criticism for the employment of this kind of hate speech, it would be quite erroneous to characterize the director's own views based on the presence of such language."}

Though possibly subject to criticism for the employment of this kind of hate speech, it would be quite erroneous to characterize the director's own views based on the presence of such language.\n\nOld Slang qua Contemporary Catchphrases\nIn conjunction with this type of non-mat (yet highly offensive) insult, the director employs other \"softer\" insults to a much greater degree than the standard mat phrases that a Russian audience might expect. The word kozyol (literally \"goat,\" but semantically understood as \"jerk\" or \"moron\") appears with remarkable frequency, and indeed seems to function as the \"go-to\" insult for the characters in the film. Another typical put-down appears in the form of the corrupt cop's catchphrase, the word debil, which linguists might translate into contemporary American English as \"dumbass,\" or to convey a more offensive connotation, one might render the word as \"retard.\" The word suka also lends itself to this category of \"default\" insults, though it tends to straddle the border between actual mat and plain vulgarity much more so than any of the other examples mentioned.\nClearly, the director opts to put these types of words into play more often than mat phrases, arguably due to their inherent specificity. They convey a much stronger sense of the individual characters' personalities, as well as a more precise characterization of the recipient of such derision. One must not forget the comedic nature of the film itself, and Balabanov emphasizes the cop's debil catchphrase to great comic effect. It seems as though the director's preference for softer comments is indicative of his own struggle against the de-semanticization of the Russian lexicon, especially with regard to mat. By not acquiescing to the standard formulas of teenage argot, he revives a part of the language that has lost its place as a particularly expressive semantic field. The highly specific meanings and connotations of words such as kozyol and debil lead to increased potency, and in turn to the film's overall poignancy.\nThese words do not constitute an encounter with the real, but that is not to say they lack the emotional coloration that Nina Mikhailovna asserts mat has lost. There is one instance where the use of profanity may indeed constitute an encounter with the real for the characters in the film, as well as the Russian audience, though it is highly atypical. This takes place when Simon curses in anger about the situation with the policeman setting them up, remarking that he has \"hated that 'fucking' pig for a long time.\" The remarkable thing here is that he actually utters the qualifier \"fucking\" in English, creating a sudden break in the symbolic order of Russian that both the characters and audience inherently belong to as a result of their common nationality. The viewer becomes aware that Simon is indeed studying English in a comical exchange where Sergei admonishes him for reading comic books (Simon replies that he is studying English with them, and mentions his desire to go abroad multiple times), but the fact that he curses in English causes a sudden break from the familiar cadence of spoken Russian that Sergei is accustomed to.\nThe avergage Russian viewer, however, would understand the English swear word. This issue also arose during the interview with Nina Mikhailovna, who explained this particular word's entrance into the Russian lexicon:\nS. Vary: In this film I noticed the use of \"English mat\" [my phrase] sometimes, the word...\nN. Mikhailovna: Fuck?\nS. Vary: For example, yes.\nN. Mikhailovna: Well, it's not surprising. In our lives, this word has become just as widespread as our own russkii mat. And when we watch American films, the exactness of the use of this word has transferred to the Russian language. And in general maybe it is partial in such a way, I assume, that for a respectable Russian person, it's difficult to get hold of a corresponding analog to a Russian word. But here and there there's a close variant, and it's easier. I'd sooner say this word than a Russian [equivalent]."}

But here and there there's a close variant, and it's easier. I'd sooner say this word than a Russian [equivalent].\n\nAt the time of the interview, she clearly believes that the word has made a clean transition into modern Russian \"alternative\" jargon, despite the fact that its exact meaning may or may not be entirely present. Considering the fact that American films have exploded in popularity over the past twenty years, it is unsurprising that such a common English word has crossed over, and the fact that Dead Man's Bluff came out in 2006 meant that the typical Russian viewer would have easily understood Simon's use of the word (albeit in a way that is different from a native English speaker's conceptualization of \"fuck\"). However, for Sergei, a Russian living in the early 1990s, it is improbable that he understands the strange word that Simon pronounces; in an earlier scene, Sergei repeatedly gets confused when Mikhailych orders them to visit \"the lawyer,\" using the English word \"lawyer\" instead of the Russian advokat. From this, one can assume that Sergei's comprehension of English is practically non-existent, and indeed Simon has to translate the word \"lawyer\" for him in a particularly comical moment.\nFrom Simon's point of view, however, he conveys the emotional \"kick\" of the word \"fuck\" with remarkable conviction, especially given the context of the rest of his statement. As Nina Mikhailovna commented, instances occasionally arise where a Russian speaker might find it easier to use an English obscenity, especially one with such a notoriously flexible definition. One can conclude that he does possess a fairly advanced grasp of the word given the fact that he uses it as an adjective, as opposed to the simple expletive \"fuck,\" which, as any native English speaker knows, generally requires no context. As before, the curse serves as an indicator of an encounter with the real - in this case Simon's fury over the cop's subversion - but it must constitute a break in the symbolic order for Sergei by virtue of the (assumed) fact that he does not understand the word, and is left without reference points (other than the context of the rest of the sentence, which is of course in Russian).\nThis is a highly significant aberration in that it breaks the symbolic order in a specifically linguistic way, and relates to the concluding analysis of Brother-2. Though Brother-2 is bereft of examples where Russians curse in English, Balabanov reverses the dynamic by placing the characters in situations where they are cursed at by Americans. An analysis of such a situation will help to illuminate this interesting facet of Balabanov's cinematic vision, as well as pertain closely to the the question of whether russkii mat has lost its potency, perhaps replaced by some new argot that is borne out of the necessity of a part of the language that is still considered dangerous and esoteric - the way mat functioned all on its own during the time of the Soviet Union.\n\tUltimately, as in War, mat serves an important role, but the role remains the same, as a secondary indicator of an encounter with the real that occurs most often through direct violence. In terms of the trend that revealed itself in the analysis of War, Balabanov demonstrates a heightened conscientiousness regarding the overuse of mat in contemporary Russian, but he effectively plays off this knowledge by limiting its frequency to moments where the scene demands it in order to remain authentic and moving, which are qualities that Russians justifiably associate with his projects. He also establishes an interesting movement in terms of replacing mat with more descriptive (though still insulting) expressions, which not only contribute to the humor and appeal of the film, but also possibly refute the earlier statement that no one individual can combat a society-wide linguistic trend. It will be highly interesting to see how these ideas continue to develop in the examination Brother-2 as the concluding analysis of this honors thesis.\n\nRace Relations gone Awry in Brother-2\nRussian title: Brat-2\nEnglish translation: Brother-2\nYear released: 2000\nWritten and directed by: Aleksei Balabanov\nStarring: Sergei Bodrov, Jr., Viktor Sukhorukov, Sergei Makovetsky\nProduction company: Kinokompaniya STV"}

This is embroiled in the Russian characters' negative perceptions of America, where the majority of the film takes place. Vladimir Shlapentokh, a Professor of sociology at the University of Michigan, aptly articulates the divide in the following passage:\nRussian nationalists maintain the third type of attitude, unrequited love on the American part ['we dislike them, but they like us']. They despise America, and believe that Americans are not aware of their negative feelings. This ideology underlies Alexei Balabanov's popular movie Brother-2, which portrays a group of Russians who travel to America, where they easily outsmart everyone they encounter.\n\nThe question of ideology is integral to the big Other, as the two concepts are synonymous, and Shlapentokh's assessment of the underlying value system is quite accurate. Danila Bagrov (Sergei Bodrov, Jr.), the hero of both Brother movies, is open about how he finds Americans extremely distasteful, commenting repeatedly on the apparent greed and hypocrisy that he sees all around him. The following exchange between Danila and a Russian prostitute, Dasha, seems to sum up his entire attitude:\nDanila: Listen, in English, what does \"how are you?\" mean?\nDasha: [in Russian] \"How are things\" or \"how are you getting along.\"\nDanila: And do they have any interest how things are for me?\nDasha: Nope, no interest.\nDanila: Then why do they ask?\nDasha: That's just how it is. Here, that's just how everything is, except for money.\n\nAs Danila and his brother Victor roam about Chicago, they practically ooze with cynicism the entire time. From Lacan's perspective, the characters are situated in a symbolic order vastly different from their own, and conequently a great deal of difficulty and confusion arises from the fact that they do not understand - or care about - the demands of the American big Other. One can arguably identify this ideology as capitalism, democracy, and freedom, i.e. the things for which Americans are willing to give their lives. Danila's lack of understanding is particularly evident in the excerpted conversation above."}

One can arguably identify this ideology as capitalism, democracy, and freedom, i.e. the things for which Americans are willing to give their lives. Danila's lack of understanding is particularly evident in the excerpted conversation above.\n\n\"Colorful\" Euphemisms and Conflicts with the Ethnic Other\nInitially, the action takes place in Moscow, and there is clear evidence of the avoidance of mat that revealed itself in the previous two analyses. An array of insults similar to those found particularly in Dead Man's Bluff constantly arises in dialogue, the most common being kozyol. The use of the word urod (\"freak\") also appears frequently, and although Russian speakers certainly do not consider the word mat, it carries undeniably insulting connotations. The Russian word breaks down lexically to mean roughly \"something removed from nature,\" and though only mildly offensive, it remains an extremely popular word. The number of semantic meanings leads to an undeniable flexibility in the word's usage, and in cinematic terms it provides a remarkable layer of depth to the characters who employ it most, from the cranky Muscovite cab driver to Danila's older brother Viktor (Viktor Sukorukhov).\nThe use of these various insults adds a creative spark to Balabanov's dialogue just as in the previous two films, and as before it becomes clear that he is well aware of the economy of his words. In fact, he appears to all but completely remove explicit mat from the films, at least upon initial inspection. Jealously watching his brother appear on a Moscow talk show, Viktor remarks \"da poshol on\" [screw him], but there is a notable ellipsis of the rest of the phrase, na khuy, which constitutes the explicit part of the ubiquitous phrase. He employs a similar phrasing when engaged in a dispute with a Chicago policeman, saying \"poshol ty\" [screw you], again excising the profane part of the expression, though it remains implicitly understood.\nAnother notable example of Balabnov's seeming avoidance of genuine mat comes in the form of a euphemism. While searching the protagonists' hideout, a thug working for the main villain, a banker named Mr. Belkin (Sergei Makovetsky), remarks that the old man at the front \"doesn't remember a fucking thing.\" Though the author of the subtitles renders the Russian phrase in English with the full degree of profanity, the character actually says \"on ni khera ni pomnit,\" which could be more aptly translated as \"he doesn't remember a damn thing,\" or even \"he doesn't remember a freaking thing.\" The key distinction here lies in the word kher, which is a common euphemism for the word khuy, meaning \"cock\" or \"dick.\"\nHistorically, the word kher has two meanings, neither of which are associated with mat: it is both the name for the Cyrillic letter \"kh,\" as well as simply meaning a \"criss-cross.\" In modern usage, however, the phonetic similarity to khuy has led to its use as a substitute, resulting from the fact that Russian speakers find the term considerably less rude. In  this sense, an English speaker can understand the analog in the occasional substitution of \"freaking\" for \"fucking,\" (when used as an adjective as opposed to the gerund). The euphemism, as a rule, must bear a phonetic resemblance, but must also significantly diminish the level of vulgarity through omission of the actual curse.\nThe preferential treatment of unconventional - or at least more colorful - insults seems to suggest once more that the director consciously avoids mat at all costs. The concept of \"colorful\" insults takes on a new meaning, however, through the liberal use of racial slurs in the film. This stems partially from the Russian misunderstanding of cultural conventions in the English language, particularly the fact that the Russian word for a black person, negr, sounds uncomfortably similar to the racial slur \"nigger.\" Danila shows his naivete in the following explanation of his use of the word, after  he unintentionally offends a black man:\nDasha: You shouldn't have called him negr.\nDanila: Then who is he?\nDasha: An African-American.\nDanila: What's the difference?\nDasha: Negr sounds offensive to them.\nDanila: That's just what I was taught in school. The Chinese live in China, Germans live in Germany, Jews live in Israel and Negroes live in Africa."}

The Chinese live in China, Germans live in Germany, Jews live in Israel and Negroes live in Africa.\n\nDanila's unawareness of American cultural sensitivities is unsurprising, but the scene heavily implies that even if he knew the difference, it would not matter in the least. This plays an important role in indicating the considerable divide between the ethnic Russians and those perceived as \"the other,\" in that not only are they unaware of the different rules, but even when informed they still perceive American values as strange and inconsequential. Viktor displays overt racism in the scene by standing up and yelling that the man is \"black like a bastard\" and \"in need of a good scrub.\" One can assume that Danila's views are strikingly similar, even if he is a bit more reserved about expressing them.\n\tBesides the racial slurs, there remains another key encounter with the ethnic other that runs parallel to the conflict between Danila and African-Americans. This is the presence of the Ukrainian mafia in the film, who receive the assignment from Mr. Belkin to track down both men and kill them. The antagonism pertains primarily to Viktor and his interactions with the Ukrainians, and provides the circumstances for even more imaginative insults, i.e. words with remarkably deep cultural and historical significance. In the airport upon his arrival in Chicago, Viktor asks advice from two Slavic-looking men on how to get downtown, addressing them as zemlyak, meaning \"countryman.\" The Ukrainian's response is \"Russians aren't my countrymen,\" and he employs an interesting term - moskal' - which exists in Ukrainian, Belorussian, and Polish as a derogatory term for a Russian, or more specifically, a Muscovite.\n\tThe use of moskal'  immediately apprises Viktor of the man's Ukrainian origins, and he counters back with the ironic question of whether the man was a \"Nazi collaborator,\" as rendered by the film's subtitles. The word that Viktor uses, banderovets, has a complex history, and the English phrase \"Nazi collaborator\" barely scratches the surface of its significance. Both a Ukrainian and a Russian would understand the term as technically denoting someone who fought in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which formed the military wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists' Bandera faction (named after Stepan Bandera, a prominent Ukrainian politician and one of the key leaders of the movement). David R. Marples articulates the considerable significance of Bandera's name and role in Ukrainian (and Russian) history:\nThe name of Stepan Bandera is one that elicits emotional reactions simply from its utterance...He has been depicted as a hero and a villain, as a liberator or potential liberator of an oppressed nation, as a terrorist and a Nazi collaborator. In the Soviet period, his name was associated with evil, terrorism, and treachery by Soviet authorities and propagandists. In various towns and villages of western Ukraine, on the other hand, statues have been erected and streets named after him, including a prominent avenue in the largest city of L'viv."}

In the Soviet period, his name was associated with evil, terrorism, and treachery by Soviet authorities and propagandists. In various towns and villages of western Ukraine, on the other hand, statues have been erected and streets named after him, including a prominent avenue in the largest city of L'viv.\n\nThe nationalistic antipathy towards the Ukrainians comes to a bloody climax in a scene towards the end of the film, where the very same man whom Viktor labeled banderovets attempts to kill him in a restaurant bathroom. Viktor avoids death by pressing himself against the wall of the stall and dodging the bullets, firing one shot in response that catches the would-be assassin square in the chest. After a quick interrogation (Viktor immediately recognizes him), he interrupts the man's plea of \"don't shoot\" with the statement \"you'll pay for Sevastopol, you pigs!\", punctuated by several more shots that end the unfortunate man's life. The reference here is difficult to pin down conclusively, but Sevastopol occupies an important place in Russia's historical mythology:\nThe cornerstone of all Russian claims to the Crimea and Sevastopol is a myth of Sevastopol as an exclusively Russian city, the 'city of Russian glory', the symbol of the Russian fleet and Russia's glorious past. For many Russian politicians the history of the Russian presence in the Crimea, Sevastopol. The former commander of the fleet, Admiral Igor Kasatonov (recalled from Sevastopol to Moscow in December 1992), stressed in an interview with the Russian newspaper Literaturnaia Rossiia that Russia in any form cannot be imagined without its glorious Black Sea fleet. To deprive Russia of the Black Sea fleet and its naval bases in the Crimea and Black Sea region would mean setting it back three centuries to the times before Peter I.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the USSR, a heated border dispute took place with Ukraine over the Sevastopol region, which resolved in the Russian leadership's forced decision to abandon its claims to the region, despite the crucial role of the Black Sea naval fleet in Russian nationalist mythology. This undoubtedly plays into Viktor's hatred of the Ukrainian, and it is particularly shocking given the fact that he executes the man immediately following the statement.\nIn a sense, the depth and complexity of such references, and Balabanov's choice to employ them, once more prove to the viewer that mat has assumed a secondary role in the Russian language. Were this not the case, mat phrases would arguably frequent Viktor's speech, but they do not provide the specificity necessary to portray him as a dedicated Russian nationalist. Thus, the trend found in Dead Man's Bluff of the director's desire to revive a more traditional part of the lexicon as a much more effective replacement for mat continues."}

Thus, the trend found in Dead Man's Bluff of the director's desire to revive a more traditional part of the lexicon as a much more effective replacement for mat continues.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\tAs revealed in the analyses, Balabanov demonstrates a remarkable economy of language in these three films, and it is precisely the infrequency of standard mat phrases that provides potency when they do in fact appear. Be it Sergei's cry of bol'no, blyad', or Aslan's violent threat against the female hostage, the examples convey a much greater emotional impact given that such expressions do not constantly re-occur. As a native Russian, Balabanov possesses a highly incisive understanding of conventional mat usage in contemporary Russian society, in which the overuse of mat is undeniable. One can argue that his decisions as a screenwriter demonstrate an attempt to change that trend, and given the remarkable popularity of his films, this must be considered entirely feasible. Russian, like any other \"living language,\" constantly undergoes changes to its lexicon through a variety of cultural influences, and cinema embodies no small part of that input. Americans certainly know how a popular filmic catchphrase can suddenly enter the general lexicon, and with such an historical appreciation for cinema in Russia, one can argue that pop-culture's impact on language operates even more prominently.\n\tOne can also imagine how mat would re-acquire a great deal of its force and significance were it to decrease in frequency, though given the penchant of young Russians for swearing,  this can arguably be considered unlikely. However, the fact that meta-profanity is far more common in Balabanov's work, one can argue that his films call for greater creativity on the part of the speaker in order to reinvigorate the language. He demonstrates this through the humorous slang terms found in Dead Man's Bluff and Brother-2, but also by employing complex historical references qua unconventional epithets that nonetheless pack a powerful emotional punch. Viktor's use of the word banderovets, as described in the previous analysis, constitutes perhaps the most fascinating instance of \"swearing\" in any of the films, despite the fact that the word itself is not profane. However, the level to which the Ukrainian addressee becomes offended by the term speaks volumes.\n\tAs mentioned, Balabanov is fully aware of the current developments in the Russian language, especially in the context of the years following the Soviet Union's dissolution. Linguistically speaking, he distinguishes his films through these various \"alternative\" expressions, and it is easy to see how his work may have a lasting impact on contemporary Russian usage. Though the Lacanian analysis demonstrated that the words themselves generally cannot constitute an encounter with the real, they certainly serve as indispensable indicators of the symbolic space constructed by the director. A lack of an encounter with the real does not necessarily indicate a lack of emotional impact or potency, though profane terms often serve to demonstrate that an encounter with the real has taken place.\n\tThough this project originally proposed that russkii mat constitutes a break in the symbolic order, one must remember that the ultimate conclusion may not always support the original assertion. While the author believes that mat does not break down the symbolic spaces inhabited by the characters in the films, the underlying goal lay in a comprehensive definition of these words' overall potency in the context of the director's cinematic vision. One must view the selected filmic texts as a reaction to the current state of the Russian language, i.e. a kind of rebellion against the de-semanticization described by Nina Mikhailovna. By using clever puns, memorable catchphrases, and complex historical and cultural references, Balabanov ostensibly creates his own version of mat, which may be classified as such due to the semantic potency these words still retain. As a genuine auteur, it seems only fitting that such a talented filmmaker has come up with such a unique take on profanity, and he owes much of his success to this astounding creativity.\n\tBalabanov continues to enjoy widespread popularity in his native land, and his appeal has even begun to spread abroad, a unique and noteworthy achievement for any Russian filmmaker. As he continues to develop his craft in subsequent films, it will be extremely interesting to observe the linguistic decisions that arise. As it stands, Russian cinephiles consider Balabanov to be on the cutting edge of the industry, and there remains little doubt that the cultural influence of his films will only increase as time goes on.\nWorks Cited"}
