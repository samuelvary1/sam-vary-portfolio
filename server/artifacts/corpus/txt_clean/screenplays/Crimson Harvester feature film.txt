The Other Side of This Life

New York, NY
(207) 318-8217
FADE IN:
INT. HOME LIBRARY
A room with a large oak desk, office chair, and shelves
filled with books from floor to ceiling. There is also a
large cabinet, upon which there sits an old record player. A
small child, ROGER, 11 years old, runs into the library and
goes straight for the cabinet. He opens it to reveal a large
collection of vintage LPs. He looks through for a moment,
carefully considering them, and then selects one and places
it on the turntable. "Freight Train Blues" by Bob Dylan
crackles through the speakers. Roger runs out of the library,
upstairs, and into a small bedroom down the hall. Toys are
scattered about, and there are two beds in the room. Playing
on the floor is Roger's young brother WILL, 8 years old. He
is adding tracks to a toy train set.
ROGER
Come on, Will! Let's go outside!
WILL
But... I just set up the station...
ROGER
You can play trains later. I found
some chairs and stuff that Dad said
we can put in the treehouse. Come
on!
Will reluctantly abandons his toys and they both run outside.
EXT. A LARGE FARMHOUSE - DAY
A white farmhouse stands on a hill with a large sprawling
yard, and a lush vegetable garden nearby. Oak and birch trees
dot the property, and there are various signs that children
live here. A swing set, a treehouse, etc. Just beyond the
garden is a small pond surrounded by cattails. A cool breeze
temporarily alleviates the heat of the bright summer day, and
the trees in the forest gently rustle their leaves. The boys
come out of the house and run down the hill towards the
forest.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Main titles roll over the music, and the brothers play in the
forest behind their house.
INT. BARN - DAY
They go to a large aluminum barn, which lies in the distance
down a narrow dirt path. Once inside they climb up into the
rafters, and they walk along them high above the ground as if
they were balance beams no more than three feet high. The sun
begins to set. Fade music.
EXT. THE POND - LATER
The boys walk around the edge of the pond. Roger carries a
small net, and Will points out frogs for Roger to try and
catch.
Their father comes to the door of the house. He is clean
shaven, wearing glasses - tall and skinny. He stands on the
porch and watches his sons play with a look of deep fondness.
He calls out to them.
DAD
Come on in boys, it's almost time
to eat!
WILL
Just a minute dad, I see a really
big bastard!
DAD
(mock angrily)
Will!! Do not use that word.
WILL
Sorry dad. Roger taught it to me.
ROGER
I did not!
DAD
All right, all right. Come inside!
I made us a nice Sunday dinner.
The boys hurry up the hill and into the house with their
father.
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
A warmly lit dining room, with three places set at a large
oak table. Family photos line the wall; among the photos
there are pictures of the boys, their father, and also a
woman, their mother.
2.
The boys bring food to the table, and Roger makes sure Will
is putting everything in the right place. They all sit down
at the table, eager to begin the meal. Dad begins dishing out
salad and the boys pick out hamburgers and hot dogs from the
plate in the middle.
DAD
What did you two do today?
ROGER
Well, we did a bunch of work on the
treehouse.
WILL
Yeah dad, we put the chairs up
there and they look really great!
Roger said we could bring a radio
up there and listen to music.
ROGER
And we want a couch and a table...
Maybe a bookshelf. Hey dad can we
live up there?
DAD
Sure but I'm gonna rent out your
rooms.
WILL
What?!
DAD
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But I
don't think you want to live out
there. What happens when it rains?
WILL
Maybe you could help us with the
roof or something?
ROGER
Yeah we could put on shingles and
stuff and make it rainproof.
DAD
We'll see...so Roger, I noticed
you've been listening to a lot of
my records lately. Do you have a
favorite album yet?
3.
ROGER
I don't know.. I really like the
Bob Dylan album, with the song
about being followed by two white
horses.
WILL
I don't like that one, Roger, it's
scary.
The meal is finished, and Dad gets up to start clearing the
dishes.
ROGER
(to Will)
What's the one you really like? The
one with the old-fashioned picture
on the front, the haystack...right?
WILL
John Barleycorn!
DAD
Wow, that one takes me back. I
listened to that all the time in
high school. You guys are way ahead
of me.
ROGER
Who is he supposed to be?
Dad comes back to the table with three bowls of ice cream.
DAD
Well, the story of John Barleycorn
goes way back in English folk
tradition. As the legend goes, John
was not a real person, but he
became the personification of
barley - do you know what that is?
The boys nod somewhat uncertainly.
DAD (CONT'D)
Well, barley was very important in
English agriculture because it was
used to make beer and whiskey...
those are um, alcoholic drinks,
you'll learn more about those when
you're older.
The boys grin at each other.
4.
DAD (CONT'D)
Anyway, the idea was that barley,
the crop itself, was just like a
person. It had to be raised
properly, like any child, and taken
care of as it got older. Above all,
it needed to be respected.
Otherwise, bad things could happen.
EXT. A BARLEY FIELD - DAY - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE
We are transported to a time long ago, the middle ages.
English peasants work in the massive barley field with
gleaming scythes. It is mid-Autumn, when Spring-planted
Barley is harvested. They gather the crop in large bushels
lashed to their backs.
INT. AN OLD MILL - DAY
We see the peasants grinding the barley with large millstones
in an old barn.
DAD (V.O.)
He was viewed as a religious figure
because when he dies, so to speak,
his body is turned into bread, and
the idea is that he suffered a lot
before dying, which he did in order
to help them.
INT. THE DINING ROOM - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT
The boys are enchanted by the story, and listen intently to
what else their father has to say.
DAD
The lesson of the story is that
when someone sacrifices so much to
help you, it's necessary to treat
that person with the utmost
respect. If you treated John
Barleycorn poorly, you could end up
on his bad side. Then your family
could go hungry... or worse, sober!
The boys both snicker.
WILL
I like that story.
5.
ROGER
Me too.
DAD
I'm glad it interests you so much.
Maybe there's some way you can
learn more about it, we ought to go
to the library tomorrow.
The table is cleared, and the boys look very sleepy.
DAD (CONT'D)
Well, it's getting late. You two
should get to bed, whaddya say?
They head upstairs, exhausted from the long day of playing.
DAD (CONT'D)
Roger, hold on, come here a second.
Roger comes back downstairs, and Will continues up to their
room.
ROGER
Yeah, dad?
DAD
I have something I want to give you
but I didn't want Will to feel bad.
ROGER
What is it?
Dad takes a small pocketknife out of his pocket, which has a
mottled wooden handle with two ducks carved on it. He hands
it to Roger.
DAD
It's called a Barlow knife, and
this is the same one that I had as
a kid. It always came in handy for
me, and I think you're old enough
to have it now.
ROGER
Wow...thank you!
DAD
Of course. Just don't make Will
jealous!
6.
ROGER
I won't. We'll carve our names in
the treehouse with it, I'll share
it with him.
DAD
Perfect. Just be careful with it,
it's very sharp!
ROGER
I will dad. Thank you.
DAD
All right. You better get off to
bed, then.
ROGER
Yes, dad.
He runs upstairs, visibly excited about his gift. Dad fondly
watches him go.
DAD
I hope he keeps it safe.
INT. THE BOYS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
The light is off, and the two boys lie peacefully in their
separate beds. Dad opens the door and peeks his head in.
DAD
Good night, boys, I love you.
WILL
I love you too dad.
ROGER
I love you too dad.
He leaves, and the two boys lie awake in the dark.
ROGER
Let's keep working on the treehouse
tomorrow.
WILL
Yeah. Can I bring my trains up
there?
ROGER
Sure. It can be our little
hideaway.
WILL
Hey Roger?
7.
ROGER
Yeah?
WILL
I was thinking... wouldn't it be
neat if someday we met John
Barleycorn?
ROGER
(yawning)
He's not real Will.
WILL
I bet he is real.
ROGER
Well, you still believe in the
tooth fairy.
WILL
I do not, Roger, I know dad put the
quarters under my pillow.
ROGER
Then why do you still keep them on
the night stand?
WILL
Just cause dad was the one who put
them there doesn't mean they aren't
magic. I know they're good luck, at
least.
ROGER
See what I mean? You believe
everything. John Barleycorn is not
real, Will.
WILL
I dunno. I just think it'd be neat
is all. Roger?
ROGER
Yeah?
WILL
Do you miss mom?
ROGER
Yeah.
8.
WILL
Me too. But I can't remember her
very well, is that bad?
ROGER
No Will, it's all right. Go to
sleep.
WILL
Good night Roger.
ROGER
Good night Will.
The boys fall asleep. Crickets and tree frogs create a
symphony of chirping outside in the hot summer night.
FADE IN.
INT. A DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT
It is a few hours after the boys have fallen asleep. Will
lies peacefully in his bed, but Roger tosses and turns in the
grips of a vivid dream.
SLOW ZOOM - ROGER
INT. A RUSTIC BEDROOM - DAY - ROGER'S DREAM
Roger is lying on a straw-filled mattress in a very oldfashioned room, reminiscent of something you would find in a
Midwestern farmhouse during the 1930s. Everything seems to be
slightly out of focus. Morning light streams in through a
single window. A wooden chair stands in the corner. Suddenly,
a gritty, wizened old voice speaks to Roger from the doorway.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Wake up, Roger.
Roger wakes from his slumber (within the dream) with a start.
He sits up to see a man in his fifties standing in the
doorway. He is dressed in the garb of a farmer from the early
20th century: a brimmed hat, denim overalls and a dusty
cotton shirt. White stubble covers his face like freshly
fallen snow. It is JOHN BARLEYCORN, in human form.
JOHN BARLEYCORN
Come with me, I want to show you
something.
9.
John leaves the room, and Roger silently gets up to follow.
They go outside.
EXT. THE PRAIRIE - AN OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY
John leads Roger out of the house, which looks remarkably
similar to the one he left behind in real life. However, the
land is dry and barren. The pond out front has dried up, and
the garden is nothing more than a patch of sunbaked dirt.
Clouds of dust blow across a field in the distance. The same
forest lies a little ways beyond, but the trees are parched
and lifeless. John is already walking towards the trees, and
he motions for Roger to follow.
INT. THE BOYS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
Will wakes up, disturbed by the commotion of Roger getting
out of bed. He looks over and immediately notices that he is
missing. Fully awake now, he gets out of bed and looks out
the window. The yard is bathed in moonlight, and it reflects
eerily off the pond. Suddenly, Will notices the small figure
of Roger just beyond. Out of the corner of his eye, he
catches a glimpse of a tall, shadowy figure at the edge of
the forest, but as quickly as he notices it, the man recedes
from view. Instinctively, Will grabs a small toy train from
his nightstand. It is his security object, a sacred good luck
charm. Still wearing his pajamas, he dashes downstairs and
outside to follow Roger.
EXT. THE FOREST - NIGHT
Will treads softly a little ways off behind Roger, who
sleepwalks ahead of him through the dark forest.
WILL
(hissed whisper)
Roger!
Roger turns around to face Will, but he does not wake up.
WILL (CONT'D)
Roger what are you doing, wake up!
Roger's slumber is far too deep for Will to shake him from
it. John has put a sort of dream spell on him. He turns away
from Will and continues deeper into the forest. Will moves
after him, but suddenly the same tall, shadowy figure steps
out next to Roger. Will gasps and ducks behind a tree,
terrified.
10.
EXT. THE PRAIRIE - DAY - ROGER'S DREAM
Roger turns away from the sound, back towards John who is
walking a few steps ahead of him.
ROGER
(dreamily)
What was that?
JOHN BARLEYCORN
Pay no mind, my young friend, it
was nothing at all. Just the wind.
Come here, I want you to have a
look at this tree.
Roger hesitantly approaches a tree that John is motioning
towards.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Will watches as the shadow man points at a tree, and his
sleepwalking brother walks towards it. It is a large, dead
oak tree, with a gaping hole in the side.
JOHN BARLEYCORN
Look inside.
Roger peers inside the tree trunk. He sees a swirling blue
pool of light, glistening with kaleidoscope images. Glimpses
of scenery flash by - a cat running along a fence, a pretty
girl riding a bicycle, a bouquet of flowers being picked. He
is enchanted, and leans in for a closer look.
ROGER
(talking in his sleep)
Wow... what is that?
JOHN BARLEYCORN
It is a doorway, Roger. It leads to
a land of opportunity, a land of
wonder. It's a place where you can
do anything you want.
Roger continues to stare, mystified.
JOHN BARLEYCORN (CONT'D)
Step through it with me and all
your wildest dreams will come
true...
11.
Roger, hypnotized by the portal and completely under John's
power, begins to climb through the hole and into the tree.
Will sees Roger climbing into the tree. He runs up to him and
shakes his shoulders, pulling him back from the hole just in
time.
WILL
Roger, wait, stop!
It is enough to shake Roger from his dream, and he steps back
from the tree. He rubs his eyes and looks around in a daze.
ROGER
Will! What's going on?
WILL
You were sleepwalking, I followed
you out here.
ROGER
(bewildered)
Oh..
WILL
Come on, we have to go back inside.
They go back in the house, and Roger gets in bed, where he
immediately falls back asleep. Will lies awake though, and
after a minute he quietly gets up and tiptoes back outside.
EXT. THE TREE - NIGHT
Will walks up to the tree, his toy train clutched firmly in
hand. He looks into the hole, and see the same blue portal
that Roger saw in his dream - it is real. Will looks deeply
into it and is hypnotized. The voice of John Barleycorn seems
to emanate directly from the depths of the pool of light.
JOHN BARLEYCORN (O.C.)
I can make all your wildest dreams
come true...
Will is completely entranced. As he stares in, his fingers
loosen and the toy train drops to the ground - he does not
notice. Barely even hesitating, he climbs into the hole and
drops into the portal, vanishing without a trace. The only
sign is his train, which lies forgotten at the foot of the
tree.
12.
EXT. THE BLUE VORTEX
Shouting with excitement, Will tumbles through the air as a
mist of blue swirls all around him, gently buffeting him
about like a leaf falling from a tree. As he falls, he
reaches out with his fingers and makes trails in the cloud
next to him. He giggles happily, and practices a few
somersaults in mid air.
Looking down, he notices that the vortex is beginning to
twist and curve, forming a sort of slide. He glides along on
the mist, spinning all around and having the time of his
life. Scenery below him starts to come into focus, and he
gradually is able to make out fields, a dirt road, and a
farmhouse. The blue mist thins out, and the ground rushes up
to meet him. Will shouts, this time in fear, and closes his
eyes. When he opens them however, he finds that he has landed
gently on the ground. He blinks his eyes and looks around.
A little ways down the road, he can see the house bathed in
sunshine. Off in the distance to the left, there is a grimlooking forest full of leafless trees. He begins to head down
the road.
EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY
Will climbs over the small fence that separates the house
from the road, and circles around to the back. He notices a
small window in the back of the house, hidden from view of
the field by a brick chimney. He walks over to it, and cups
his ear. Three men are in the kitchen having a conversation.
MAN #1
He was supposed to come through an
hour ago. Where could he possibly
go but here?
MAN #2
Something's wrong. He didn't make
it through.
MAN #3
John said he would, and so we wait.
MAN #2
I don't like it.
13.
MAN #1
Maybe there was some kind of delay.
He has to be careful, tread
lightly. It's a different world
over there.
Will notices an old wooden crate underneath the window, and
he places it underneath as a step. He climbs up in order to
get a better listening post.
MAN #2
And how long until we go and tell
him there is no boy?
MAN #3
Relax, Daniel. He's going to fall
right in our lap.
Will stands on his tiptoes to try and get even closer, but at
that moment the crate gives way and he collapses in a heap
beneath the window. He coughs and gets up to his knees,
dusting himself off. A door slams. Steps approach. He begins
to look up, and notices three ominously tall shadows suddenly
taking position around him. He turns around with a start. The
three men are standing over him with their arms crossed.
MAN #1
Well, hello there.
INT. THE BOYS' BEDROOM - DAY
Sun streams in through the window, and birds chirp outside.
Roger wakes up and stretches, ready to start the day.
However, his excitement quickly turns to confusion - he flips
back the sheets, to reveal his bare feet caked with mud and
dirt. He looks over to Will's bed - the covers are thrown
back, and he is nowhere to be seen.
ROGER
Oh no...
He rushes downstairs, then walks through the different rooms
of the house as he searches for his brother with increasing
desperation.
ROGER (CONT'D)
Will, where are you? This isn't
funny...
Finding no sign of him anywhere downstairs, he goes outside.
14.
EXT. THE FOREST - DAY
Roger walks through the forest, desperately scanning for any
sign. He recognizes the tree a little ways in the distance
and dashes over. He kneels at the foot of the tree, looking
for some sort of clue. After a moment, he spots something -
Will's toy train, lying forgotten on the ground. Swallowing
hard, he gets up slowly and peers over the edge of the hole.
The portal is there, still as enchantingly beautiful as the
night before. Nervously, he touches it with his fingertips,
but recoils quickly. He examines his fingers with a strange
look, as if they had just been separated from his body. He
dashes back to the house.
INT. THE KITCHEN
Roger has changed out of his pajamas into slightly more
adventurous attire, and he busies himself in the kitchen,
throwing together some peanut butter sandwiches. He wraps
them and stuffs them into a small knapsack. We see that it
also contains a compass and binoculars. He checks to make
sure that the Barlow knife is in his pocket. He slings the
pack over his shoulder, and quietly walks upstairs to his
father's room.
THE BOYS' ROOM
Roger grabs the two quarters that Will keeps on his night
stand (for good luck, of course).
DAD'S BEDROOM
Roger opens the door just enough to look in on his dad, who
is sleeping peacefully. He closes the door.
EXT. THE FOREST - DAY
Roger troops back out to the tree, his backpack on his
shoulder, the toy train gripped firmly in his hand. He looks
back at the house, which appears peaceful and safe. With grim
determination, he continues towards the tree, and climbs over
the edge of the hole without a word. Roger plunges into the
blue spiral, vanishing exactly as Will did. He tumbles
through space and time with his eyes squeezed shut, but after
a moment he is able to open them, and is astonished by the
current of blue effervescence that swirls about his body. The
ground rushes up at him, and he closes his eyes to await the
impact. But again, like Will, he finds that he has landed
safely on the ground.
15.
EXT. A WINDSWEPT DIRT ROAD - DAY
The lifeless, brown prairies of a dustbowl. Dried out land
stretches along an endless dirt road lined with barbed wire
fencing. The landscape is dotted with dried up trees and
bushes, and it is clear that life is scarce. Roger
immediately notices the old farmhouse in the distance, and
checks his compass. It shows east, and he turns around to
face the horizon in the west, facing away from the house. The
road stretches off into endlessness, where strange gray
clouds hover above the horizon. He puts it back in his pocket
and begins to head down the road to the farmhouse.
EXT. THE PORCH
Roger arrives at the front porch of the house, where rickety
wooden stairs lead up to a screen door. He goes inside.
INT. THE HOUSE
He looks around apprehensively. He is standing in a small
kitchen, and through an opening on the right a modest living
room is visible. He looks upstairs and sees bedroom doors
lining the second floor landing. In the kitchen there is a
table with three chairs and three places set. Some baskets of
vegetables sit in the corner near an old iron stove attached
to the wall. Some rusty farm tools are leaning next to it.
ROGER
(nervously)
Hello? Is there anyone here?
He moves further into the kitchen, towards a small window
that looks out onto a large field of barley behind the house.
Through it, he can see three men working in the field with
scythes. They wear brimmed hats, overalls, and ragged cotton
shirts.
EXT. THE FIELD
Roger stands by the edge of the swaying barley.
ROGER
Um.. Hi!
The men instantly look up from their work with hawk-like
quickness.
16.
ROGER (CONT'D)
I need some help, I think I'm lost!
I... don't know where I am.
The men speak amongst themselves for a moment, and then
stride purposefully towards Roger. It is NATHAN, ISAAC, and
DANIEL, the same three men we last saw with Will. Nathan is
tall, with a thick brown beard. He stands in the center, and
appears clearly as the leader of the group. Isaac and Daniel
stand slightly behind him, looking wary. They look Roger over
with unusually keen interest.
NATHAN
What's your name, son?
ROGER
Roger.
NATHAN
I'm Nathan. These are my brothers
Isaac and Daniel.
ROGER
But... where am I?
NATHAN
This is our farm. Come inside,
maybe I can answer some of your
questions.
INT. THE KITCHEN
Nathan, Isaac, and Daniel are clearly exhausted from a hard
day of work, and the scythes weigh heavily on their
shoulders. They rest them on the wall and take their hats
off, then take their seats at the table. Nathan drags an
extra chair over to the table with his foot and motions for
Roger to sit.
NATHAN
Have a seat, son.
Roger reluctantly does so.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Now, from the looks of you I'd say
you're a long way from home. Why
don't we start with how you got
here.
17.
ROGER
Well, I guess it started with this
dream I had. I found a tree with a
big hole in it, and there was a
pool of swirling light inside. I
went out this morning and it was
still there, so I climbed through
and now... here I am. The thing is,
my little brother, Will... he went
through first, and now I don't know
where he is. I have to find him,
maybe you've seen him?
The men glance at each other, then back at Roger.
ISAAC
What does your brother look like?
ROGER
He's eight years old, with brown
hair and blue eyes. I think he's
wearing his pajamas, that's what he
must have been wearing when he went
through. They have trains on them.
Have you seen him?
NATHAN
No, no.. we haven't seen anyone.
Hardly anyone ever comes here. Just
the three of us. Roger, how old are
you?
ROGER
I'm eleven.
NATHAN
Strange...
ROGER
Can you help me find him?
DANIEL
Well, this is a big place. It's
hard to say if he even could be
found. We wouldn't know where to
look.
ISAAC
Although, there is a train that
runs by not far from here. Maybe he
jumped on a boxcar, in which case
he would be going east.
18.
ROGER
(confused)
But, why would he do that? He's
very little, and if the train isn't
far from here, why wouldn't he have
seen your farm and come looking for
help?
NATHAN
(abruptly)
We have a room you can stay in
upstairs, Roger. You must be
exhausted, you should rest.
ROGER
Okay. But I have to find him...
Nathan leads him upstairs as Isaac and Daniel pack their
pipes in the kitchen.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Nathan leads Roger into a small bedroom, furnished only by a
mirror, a wooden chair, and a bed with a straw-filled
mattress. Thoroughly exhausted, Roger sits down on the bed.
Nathan quietly leaves the room, shutting the door gently
behind him. Roger looks out his window at the prairie, where
long shadows are cast by the setting sun. He takes off his
shoes and lays down on the bed, quickly falling asleep.
INT. A DUNGEON - NIGHT - ROGER'S DREAM
A dusty hallway with hay strewn about on the floor. The
corridor is lined with prison cells. Roger sees himself
walking down the hallway in slow motion. He gets to the last
cell on the right, and turns to see a young boy behind the
bars. His head is in his hands and we hear him sobbing
quietly.
ROGER
Will?
The boy looks up, but his face is nothing but a swirling
cloud of brown dust.
INT. ROGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Roger awakens with a gasp.
19.
The room is completely dark except for the pale glow of the
harvest moon, which casts its light through the single-pane
window. Eerie shadows dance around the room. Muffled voices
drift up through the floor, and he realizes he can hear the
men talking. After a moment of trying to make out what they
are saying, he quietly gets out of bed and steps onto the
floor. He presses his ear to a small crack, and is able to
hear their conversation quite clearly. The three of them are
sitting in the kitchen, smoking pipes and pouring glasses of
liquor from a bottle on the table.
INT. KITCHEN
DANIEL
I think we should bring him
tonight. This could be the answer
that we've been waiting for.
NATHAN
We've already brought him one boy,
isn't that enough?
DANIEL
But think if we brought him two!
The reward would be... substantial.
ISAAC
He's right. If we came to John a
day later with another healthy boy,
it would practically guarantee a
full harvest this year.
DANIEL
It's an opportunity we can't afford
to miss. After all, he just fell in
our lap! They both did. Did you
forget that John intended that to
happen? The first one, at least.
ISAAC
Exactly. He'll be surprised by a
second.
NATHAN
Well... all right. We'll take him
in the morning. Let the poor boy
get some rest tonight, he's going
to need it.
20.
INT. ROGER'S BEDROOM
Roger leaps up, his breath quick, near panic. He scurries
back into bed as he hears the heavy sound of boot steps
coming up the stairs. He pulls the covers over himself just
in time. Nathan opens the door to check on him, but he
succeeds in pretending to be asleep. Satisfied, Nathan
leaves, and the men retire to their separate rooms. Complete
silence settles over the house. Roger walks softly to the
door, carrying his shoes so as not to make any noise. He
listens at the door, then gently tries the handle. The door
opens and he steps out into the hall. Being ever so careful
to avoid any creaking, he makes his way downstairs, and opens
the screen door which leads out onto the front porch.
He shuts the door slowly to prevent it from banging, and then
he turns and slips on his shoes. He leaps off the porch,
already running.
EXT. THE ROAD - NIGHT
He hits the ground running and takes off full-speed down the
dusty moonlit road. The farmhouse is left behind, looming
ominously in the night. We follow Roger on his run down the
road, and he does not stop until the farmhouse is well out of
sight. He stops a moment to catch his breath. As his
breathing slows, he notices a slight rumble in the ground,
gradually getting louder. He approaches a ridge a little ways
ahead. The rumbling continues to gain volume, and he climbs
to the top of the ridge. Below lie train tracks, and a train
moving briskly along. All he can see are boxcars.
Roger runs down to where the ground meets the tracks and runs
alongside the train. He catches up to the side of a boxcar,
and tosses his knapsack onboard. A moment later he is able to
grab on and pull himself up into the car.
INT. AN (ALMOST) EMPTY BOXCAR
Roger collapses on the dusty floor, quite out of breath. A
man's voice comes out of the darkness.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
What's this? A boy? How strange!
Roger gasps and looks up. A large black crow steps out of the
shadows. Roger is stunned, and tries to form words but
nothing comes out. Before him stands PERCY, a talking crow.
21.
PERCY
Don't worry, you have nothing to
fear from me, I'm just an old bird.
My name is Percy.
Roger pushes himself off the floor and sits back against the
wall. He stares in disbelief at the bird.
ROGER
You scared me.
PERCY
That's funny, I don't feel like a
scarecrow today.
ROGER
Do you live here?
PERCY
Oh, I just ride the train, watching
the prairie roll by. Sometimes I
run into fellow travelers, but they
are few and far between.
ROGER
Where does this go?
PERCY
To the East. There's an old woman
who lives out there that I need to
see. She's the only one who can
help me fly again.
ROGER
You can't fly?
PERCY
That's why I ride the train. I used
to be able to.
ROGER
What happened?
Percy wistfully looks off into the night.
PERCY
Well... I made a mistake. I had to
be taught a lesson.
22.
EXT. A CATTLE PEN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Two small calves lie curled up in the hay of their pen,
sleeping soundly. Percy is perched on the corner of an
aluminum shed attached to the side of the pen, and he watches
over the two animals.
PERCY (V.O.)
A long time ago, I worked for a
farmer who had just received two
newborn calves as a gift. He
received them as a reward for a
season of hard work. They were
beautiful creatures, both of them
were pure white. I was responsible
for watching them. Coyotes come out
at night around here, and I was
supposed to send up warning if any
should come near.
A full moon shines brightly above the scene, and Percy looks
about. Then, in a flutter of motion, he leaves his perch on
and flies off into the night, leaving the calves unattended.
PERCY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I love...er, I loved to fly. I
hated standing still, and it was
such a beautiful night, with the
full moon and everything. So I took
off, just to stretch my wings a
bit.
EXT. THE WILD PRAIRIE
Percy flies over the scenery, and he swoops low to weave
through the trees. He closes his eyes with pleasure as he
effortlessly glides through the air.
EXT. THE CATTLE PEN
Two menacing coyotes sneak up to the pen, and they manage to
undo the latch on the gate. The calves sleep on, completely
oblivious to their imminent demise. The coyotes snarl, and
pounce on their unsuspecting prey.
PERCY (V.O.)
I was only gone for a few minutes,
but when I got back they had come
and...it was far too late.
23.
EXT. AN OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY
Percy stands outside of a house on the front porch. We see
the back of a man dressed in the same attire that John
Barleycorn was wearing in Roger's dream, though we do not see
his face. He towers over Percy, who trembles with fear in his
shadow. The man bends over to pick him up, and holds him
gently in his hands.
PERCY (V.O.)
Those calves were a gift from a
very powerful man. He was greatly
displeased that I allowed them to
be destroyed. When I told him what
happened, he decided that I didn't
deserve to fly anymore.
The man runs a long, gnarled finger down Percy's spine as he
lies helpless in his grasp. He touches each one of his wings,
and then sets him down on the ground. Wind swirls across the
fields, and Percy hops about, flapping his wings uselessly.
PERCY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
That man's name was John
Barleycorn.
We then see Barleycorn's face, the same face that Roger saw
in his dream. He smiles slyly, and turns to go back inside.
Percy hops down off the porch and up to the road, leaving the
house behind.
INT. THE BOXCAR - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY
ROGER
You mean... John Barleycorn is a
real person?
PERCY
Oh, he's real. And like I said, he
is very powerful. Where were you
running from?
ROGER
These strange men...there were
three men that I met. When I got
here, I saw their house and I went
to it looking for help.
PERCY
Far from home, are you?
24.
He nods.
PERCY (CONT'D)
I could tell. Those men are
probably the last people that I
would go to for help.
ROGER
Well, I overheard them talking. I
think they took my little brother,
Will, to John Barleycorn. I don't
know why though.
PERCY
Your little brother... are you
positive?
ROGER
Yes, I'm sure it was him. That's
why I ran away, they were going to
take me too.
PERCY
Ah, this is very bad. Those three
men, they work for John. I'm sure
you're right, the question is, what
does he want with your brother?
ROGER
I don't know, I just have to get
him back.
PERCY
I think you need to come see a
friend of mine, the old woman that
I mentioned. Her name is Mother
Florence, and I think she may be
able to help you, too.
EXT. THE LINE OF BOXCARS
The cars chug along the track through the night, disappearing
over the horizon. Roger and Percy sit by the opening on the
side, looking out over the prairie.
EXT. THE FARM - DAY
NATHAN (O.C.)
He's gone.
25.
INT. ROGER'S BEDROOM
Nathan stands in the doorway to Roger's bedroom. Isaac and
Daniel crowd around the doorway behind him with looks of
disbelief on their faces.
NATHAN
(grimly)
John will need to know about this.
Immediately.
EXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAY
Nathan, Isaac, and Daniel approach the door, and Nathan
knocks rather meekly. After a beat John Barleycorn himself
opens the door. He looks at them with disdain, as if he
already knows what they are going to tell him.
JOHN
Well, come in.
INT. JOHN'S HOUSE
The inside of the house is sparsely decorated. There is a
main dining hall, with a fireplace off to the side. The
kitchen lies a little ways beyond.
DINING HALL
John sits at the head of the table, and he motions for the
three other men to take a seat as well.
JOHN
(wearily)
Now, what is it you've come to see
me about?
NATHAN
Another boy came to our house. We
think it's the one you were after.
Originally.
JOHN
And you have him, I trust?
NATHAN
We...ah...we lost him. In the
middle of the night he ran off. He
must have heard us talking. We were
talking about his brother.
26.
John stands up in anger, looking down wrathfully upon the
three men. They cower under his gaze.
JOHN
You...lost...him?!
NATHAN
But we can find him again! We will
find him and bring him here to you
and... think about it John, let us
find him.
JOHN
Forget it, I can't trust you idiots
with anything.
John sits back down, his brow furrowed with worry.
JOHN (CONT'D)
He could be anywhere now, you know.
You three would never be able to
track him down. I'll need someone
else to find him.
NATHAN
But John, we did bring you the
younger one, doesn't that mean
anything?
JOHN
You fools, I delivered him right to
you, all you had to do was bring
him here. Same with the other one,
but you couldn't handle that. No, I
need men who are slightly more
competent.
Nathan looks deeply offended.
NATHAN
What are you going to do now?
JOHN
I'm calling my Rangers.
EXT. A WIDE EXPANSE OF PRAIRIE - DAY
Somewhere in the wilderness beyond John's farmhouse. Two men,
LUTHER and MARTIN, are riding white horses at full gallop
across the field. They race each other at breakneck speed,
urging their horses faster and faster.
27.
They are extremely large, as are their horses, and they look
like they could pick someone up and toss them through the
air. They are dressed in the uniform of workers for the Pony
Express - trousers, cotton shirts, leather vests, bandanas,
wide-brimmed cowboy hats, and six-shooters slung in hip
holsters. They ride across the plain and John's farmhouse
comes into view. They gallop towards it, whooping and
shouting as they approach. Soon they arrive, where they find
John waiting outside by the garden with Nathan.
JOHN
Good day, gentlemen.
LUTHER
Howdy, boss. It's a hot one out
there today.
JOHN
Nathan, these are my Rangers.
Luther, and Martin.
Nathan squints up at them nervously. Their spurs glint in the
hot sun.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Well boys I'll get straight to the
point. The imbecile you see
standing beside me is responsible
for the loss of a very important
asset, which happens to belong to
me.
The two Rangers look at Nathan as if he is a bug.
MARTIN
What'd he lose, boss?
JOHN
A boy.
LUTHER
A boy?
JOHN
I have his younger brother. I
wouldn't have called on you two if
this wasn't a matter of the utmost
importance. But I need him brought
to me. Unharmed.
Luther and Martin look at each other, considering the task at
hand.
28.
LUTHER
You got it, boss.
JOHN
Good. Now, Nathan here thinks he
hopped on board a train headed
east, towards Mother Florence's
camp. Sounds like a pretty good tip
to me.
MARTIN
What's he look like?
JOHN
He's eleven years old, a young boy
with brown hair. He's the only
other child in this place, I should
think he'd be pretty unmistakable.
MARTIN
We'll find him.
JOHN
You will be richly rewarded, of
course. Now go!
The two horsemen ride into the distance, off in pursuit of
Roger.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I suggest you gather your things
and go home before I lose my
temper. You have tried my patience
enough for one day.
Without a word, Nathan goes back inside and tells Isaac and
Daniel that it is time to go. They march along down the road
back in the direction of their house, hanging their heads
dejectedly. He glares after them from the front porch, and
turns to go back inside. He slams the screen door behind him.
EXT. THE TRAIN - DAY
The train continues to move steadily through the prairie, a
large plume of smoke coming out of the stack on the engine.
INT. BOXCAR
Roger looks out the side of the boxcar, watching the scenery
drift by.
29.
He looks into the knapsack to see if there are any un-smushed
sandwiches, but they are completely crushed beyond
recognition. He sighs.
PERCY
Cheer up, Roger, we'll find your
brother!
ROGER
I know, but...I'm really hungry.
PERCY
Well, you know, for a crow I have a
lot of tricks up my sleeve. I
managed to procure some breakfast
for us. I knew you would be
famished.
Roger looks over and sees that Percy has produced a large
loaf of bread, which is sitting neatly on a cloth napkin
beside him.
ROGER
(astonished)
Where did you get that?
PERCY
Being able to talk isn't my only
unusual ability.
Roger hungrily digs into the bread, tearing off large hunks
and chewing eagerly. Percy offers him a canteen of water,
which he gulps down.
PERCY (CONT'D)
The person we're going to see,
Mother Florence, is a very wise,
kind old woman. She's going to help
me fly again, and I'm sure she'll
know what to do about your brother.
ROGER
Where does she live?
PERCY
There's a small campsite not far
from here where she lives with her
children. We'll be there soon I
think.
30.
EXT. TRAIN
It continues its journey through the wasted landscape, while
Roger and Percy remain seated on the edge of the boxcar.
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - LATER
The train tracks run through a gap in the fencing by the side
of the road. It is the same place that Roger first saw the
train after running away, and the two horsemen calmly trot up
to inspect the area. Luther hops off his horse, and walks
slowly up to a patch of earth where Roger's footprints are
still visible in the dust. Martin pulls on his reigns, as his
horse stamps about restlessly.  Luther scoops up some of the
dust and tosses it into the wind.
LUTHER
He was just here.
MARTIN
He must'a come straight here after
he ran away. Lucky kid, he just
happened to wind up at the tracks
when the train was comin' by.
LUTHER
Yeah, well...maybe luck didn't have
anything to do with it.
Luther looks off down the tracks, to the east.
LUTHER (CONT'D)
We'll never catch him if we stay on
the tracks. We'll need to take a
shortcut.
He gets up and deftly mounts his horse, spinning her around
towards east.
LUTHER (CONT'D)
Come on, let's ride!
The men gallop off down the road, away from the train tracks.
They send up a great plume of dust behind them, and are gone.
INT. THE THREE BROTHERS' HOUSE - NIGHT
Nathan, Daniel, and Isaac return from their trip to John
Barleycorn's and morosely troop inside to the kitchen.
31.
They sit down heavily at the table, and Nathan immediately
brings out a tobacco pouch and starts packing his pipe.
Daniel takes a bottle of amber liquid from the center of the
table and pours a glass for himself, and then two more for
his brothers.
DANIEL
Well I don't think that could have
gone any worse, do you?
NATHAN
Nope.
DANIEL
You know, every year we play the
same game; we do what John wants
and then he spits on us.
ISAAC
Ever since he brought us over.
DANIEL
That was a long time ago.
Daniel takes a long draught from his glass.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
And you know he's just going to do
the same thing to those boys. Cut
them off from their home, and keep
them here forever.
ISAAC
Just like us.
NATHAN
And so what do you two
revolutionaries propose we do?
DANIEL
What happens when John dies? All
his indentured servants go free,
forever...
ISAAC
...and we can live in peace.
DANIEL
Isn't it plain to see? We've known
this for years Nathan. John
Barleycorn must die.
Daniel takes another gulp of his drink.
32.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
He is pretty old, after all.
NATHAN
Don't be foolish, it can't be done.
DANIEL
Well, we have to do something!
NATHAN
Those boys don't deserve to be kept
here like us. No one deserves that.
ISAAC
It's true. We missed our chance to
get home, but maybe we can prevent
them from missing theirs.
NATHAN
So what must be done?
DANIEL
Once John opens a portal, it always
closes at midnight on that day. If
we leave now, we should be able to
get there in plenty of time.
Nathan taps out his pipe and stands up, ready to go.
NATHAN
Well, what are we waiting for?
We've got a job to do.
DANIEL
Wait, there's just one other
thing...
He gets up and goes over to the wall, where the scythes are
leaning. He picks one up, hefting it easily in his weathered
hands.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
We're bringing these.
INT. A DUNGEON - NIGHT
A short set of stairs leads into a dusty, hay-strewn
corridor, lined with prison cells. The dungeon appears to
have once been used as a horse barn, but the stalls have had
their gates replaced by formidable iron bars. In a cell on
the right we see Will, his tiny hands wrapped around the
bars. He is quietly weeping.
33.
His cell is not entirely unpleasant, however; a comfortablelooking cot stands off to one side, and a hand-carved wooden
rocking chair sits in the other corner, next to a stack of
books. In the far corner there is a small water pump, along
with a basin.
Suddenly, a key turns in the door at the top of the stairs.
With a loud metallic groan, it opens, and we hear the heavy
boot steps of a man approaching. Will looks up hopefully and
sees MANDRAKE, a guard employed by John Barleycorn. He is
extremely tall and lithe, and wears a thick black moustache.
He is dressed in the garb of a Union soldier, ca. 1863, and
large cavalry pistol hangs in a holster on his belt. His
boots click smartly as he turns to stand in front of Will's
cell.
MANDRAKE
John would like you to come
upstairs for a bit. Would that be
all right with you, son?
Will sniffs and looks up at him.
WILL
I don't know, mister.. I just want
to go home.
MANDRAKE
This is home, my boy! John has big
plans for you. Come on up, he just
wants to chat. Some new living
quarters are to be arranged as
well.
Will moves back from the door and allows Mandrake to unlock
and open it. He steps out into the yellow light of the
corridor, and Mandrake claps a hand on his shoulder. They
begin to walk down the hall towards the door.
MANDRAKE (CONT'D)
You have to understand, your
current room was just a precaution.
WILL
I miss my dad...
MANDRAKE
(ignoring the comment)
Wait until you see our dining hall!
They continue up the stairs through the door. It clangs shut
behind them, and Mandrake turns the key in the lock with a
loud crunch.
34.
INT. ROGER AND PERCY'S BOXCAR - DAY
Roger is sleeping on the floor of the car, using his backpack
as a pillow. A slight bump from the train jostles him awake,
and he gets up, rubbing his eyes. He looks around for Percy,
and realizes he is nowhere to be found. A look of panic
flashes into his eyes, and he looks out from the boxcar,
desperately scanning the landscape and the length of the
train for some sign of his friend. Suddenly, a voice calls
from above.
PERCY (O.S.)
Roger! Up here!
Roger looks up to see Percy peering over the side of the
roof.
ROGER
What are you doing up there?!
PERCY
We have to go see the conductor!
He'll make sure we get dropped off
at Mother Florence's.
ROGER
Conductor?
PERCY
Well, of course. Did you think this
train was driving itself?
ROGER
No...I guess not.
PERCY
Come on, there's a ladder next to
the door. Watch your step!
Roger leans out and sees the rungs attached to the side of
the train. He grabs on and begins climbing up. Percy helps
him get onto the roof, and he stands up to admire the
panoramic view. The train stretches out behind them in a
seemingly endless line, but ahead of them the main cab is
visible a few cars off.
ROGER
What else is on this train?
Percy begins making his way towards the front, and Roger
follows.
35.
PERCY
(nonchalant)
Oh, just about everything you could
possibly imagine. And a few things
that you couldn't.
The climb across to the next car, and continue marching
forward to the next one, and the next one. They stop on the
edge of a green fuel tanker, which has a ladder going down to
a flatbed.
PERCY (CONT'D)
We'll have to climb down now, and
I'm going to take you through these
cars. Be sure to follow me closely,
you'd be surprised at how easy it
is to get lost in here.
ROGER
(nervously)
Okay...
They both climb down the ladder, and approach the door to the
first car. It is strangely ornate, painted red.
PERCY
Now, Roger, I need you to give
three good knocks on that door.
Don't be shy!
Roger looks at him somewhat skeptically, but steps forward
and does as he is asked. A moment after the third knock, the
door cracks open, revealing a sliver of warm, glowing light.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Well, go on, open it!
Roger gently pushes the door open, and the light from inside
spills out over the travelers. A look of wonder is plastered
on Roger's face. He and Percy step forward into the light,
and the door claps shut behind them.
EXT. A BEAUTIFUL PASTURE - DAY
Percy and Roger step out of the doorway into a wide open
field of swaying grass. The only evidence of the train is the
door frame behind them, which stands alone in the field,
oddly out of place. The pasture slopes down a hill, and is
lined on all sides by a wooden fence. Roger looks around in
wonder and disbelief.
36.
ROGER
Percy...where are we?
PERCY
Oh this is just car #17. Once we
cross this pasture, we only have to
get through 18 and 19 before we are
able to see the conductor. He's in
number twenty.
ROGER
What do you mean, 'get through'?
PERCY
Well, you can't exactly stroll
through this place. Do you think
the conductor makes special stops
for just anybody? Just stay close
to me and we'll be all right.
Roger swallows hard, and they proceed forward, wading through
the grass. Percy hops about here and there, and he seems to
be watching the ground quite closely. Roger wanders off to
the side, looking at some exotic-looking flowers that have
sprung up close to the fence.
ROGER
Hey, Percy, come look at this one!
Roger stops at a very bright, pink flower that sticks out of
the grass, strangely isolated from any of the other flowers.
He looks closer, and sees that a pistle extending from the
center of the flower is waving about, appearing to taste the
air. Percy hops over, a concerned look on his face.
PERCY
Roger, come along, you shouldn't go
near that.
ROGER
But Percy look! It's like it's
thinking or something.
PERCY
Roger we have to keep mov-...!
All of a sudden, the earth around the flower begins to
crumble and rise as a massive creature heaves up from below.
The entire field seems to shake, and clods of dirt fall away
as a massive mole-like animal emerges, the strange pink
flower firmly attached to its head. He snaps about blindly
and viciously, searching for the intruders. Roger and Percy
stand below, cowering in the shadow of the beast.
37.
They are frozen in place. The creature picks up on their
scent, and lets out an earth-shaking bellow. It lowers its
rose-topped head and prepares to charge.
PERCY (CONT'D)
(panicking)
Roger, RUN!!!
They both snap out of their trance and turn to sprint across
the field in the other direction. It takes off after them,
furiously roaring and gnashing its teeth. Percy hops along at
breakneck pace, and Roger runs quickly through the swaying
grass. Moving along the fence, they look back and see that
their pursuer is loping along at a frightening pace, and is
quickly gaining ground on the terrified travelers. The pink
flower on its head appears to be acting as its compass,
swiveling to stay pointed at Roger and Percy even as they
duck and weave through the grass.
Roger and Percy keep going forward, and a short distance
ahead they see that the fence continues on a little further,
leading straight to another door that looks much the same as
the one they entered through. It stands out alone in the
grass, apparently not leading anywhere.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Come on, we're almost there!
ROGER
I think it's getting closer!!
PERCY
Just keep running! Once we get to
the exit, we'll be safe!
They continue to speed through the grass, and the door grows
ever closer. The beast, however, has almost caught up to
them. It nips at Roger's heels, and he pumps his young legs
to muster a little extra speed and stay ahead.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Roger, look in your pockets, find
something, anything to throw at
him!
Roger is terrified, but he manages to reach into the breast
pocket of his shirt and retrieve his pocketknife. He flips it
open, just as the monster lunges forward to try and bite one
of his legs off. Roger swings out with the knife, scoring a
solid hit on the stem of the flower. The animal recoils with
a loud roar of pain and confusion, and the wounded flower
droops uselessly across its face. It gives Percy and Roger
enough time to make it to the door.
38.
Roger flings it open, and they collapse onto a platform
between two ordinary looking train cars. The door slams shut
behind them.
ROGER
What...was...that thing?
PERCY
That was something that was not
meant to be trifled with, my young
friend.
ROGER
But all I did was look at the
flower!
PERCY
Exactly! I told you, it's easier to
get lost - in more ways than one -
than you think. We have to be
careful from now on. This train can
be dangerous.
ROGER
Percy, I don't think I like this
game.
PERCY
It's no game, Roger. You do want to
get your brother back, don't you?
ROGER
Of course!
PERCY
And you won't give up, no matter
what?
ROGER
No matter what.
PERCY
Well, so, you know how I feel about
getting my wings back. We can't do
that unless we get to Mother
Florence! Without her help, it
would be impossible.
ROGER
I'm sorry, Percy, I didn't mean to
cause so much trouble.
39.
PERCY
Oh, well... we're both safe, aren't
we?
ROGER
Yes.
PERCY
Right. So, chin up! We've got to
keep moving.
Percy and Roger catch their breath, then stand to approach
the next door.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Just like before, my friend. Three
good knocks, if you please.
Roger does as he is asked, and once again the door
mysteriously opens on its own.
EXT. A LARGE CAVE - NIGHT
Roger and Percy step out from the doorway onto a stony path
in the middle of a very large cavern. Stalactites and
stalagmites jut out from above and below, and the sound of
dripping water resonates off the limestone walls. Torches
line the wall alongside the path, and Roger boldly takes one
out of its holder. Percy winces.
ROGER
Come on, let's go!
PERCY
Ah, I'm not sure you should
take...never mind, let's go.
They proceed on down the path. Soon they are able to hear the
sound of running water.
ROGER
What is that?
PERCY
It sounds like an underground
river. I think we'll be able to see
it around this corner.
Continuing forward, the duo round the corner and as
predicted, a wide running river is flowing along through the
cave.
40.
The water is dark and churning, with white-capped waves
appearing here and there. The path turns down and continues
along a small ridge a few feet above the water.
ROGER
So, if we just follow this path,
it'll take us to the next door,
right?
PERCY
Yes, unless of course we happen
upon some sort of obstacle. For
example...
Percy's point is illustrated for him as they find the path
opening up into a clearing by the river, surrounded by solid
rock walls. Looking across, they can see that the path
continues to wind through the cave a little ways up. The
river is wide, and the water is black as ink. A small
ferryboat rests on the shore, but does not appear to be
attended.
ROGER
Come on! We can hop in this boat
and float right to the other shore.
PERCY
I don't think that's such a good
idea, Roger. The water is moving
too fast, we'd go sailing right
past it and end up who knows where.
Plus, if I remember correctly, that
boat belongs to...
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Greetings.
Percy and Roger whirl around to see CHARON, the ferryman. He
is dressed in a black robe tied around the waist, and his
face is extremely pale and aged. He carries a very large
staff, long enough to guide the boat through the water.
ROGER
Who are you?
CHARON
I am Charon, the ferryman. I can
take you across the river.
ROGER
Really? That's great! Come on
Percy, let's get in the boat.
41.
CHARON
Wait. First, you must pay the fare.
ROGER
Fare?
Percy takes Roger aside.
PERCY
He needs coins, Roger. One for each
of us. We may as well head back
now, there's no other way to cross.
ROGER
But we have to! You said so
yourself, if we don't see Mother
Florence, I'll never get my brother
back and you'll never be able to
fly again!
PERCY
I know that Roger, but without the
coins we aren't going anywhere.
ROGER
Hold on a minute...
Roger digs around in his pockets, searching for the quarters
he took off the nightstand before he left. He finds them and
holds them out to Percy.
ROGER (CONT'D)
One for each of us, right?
PERCY
(amazed)
Where did you get those?
ROGER
I borrowed them...from my brother.
He says they're good luck. I didn't
believe him but now... well, we can
get across can't we?
PERCY
Yes, I think we can!
Roger gives one of the coins to Percy, and they confidently
walk over to Charon.
ROGER
Two for the ferry, please, Mr.
Charon, sir.
42.
Without a word, he accepts the coins and walks over to the
ferry, stepping in.
CHARON
Come along. I will take you across
now.
Roger and Percy get into the boat, and Charon uses his staff
to push them all the way out into the water. The current
quickly takes control of the boat, and they begin to move
downstream towards the opposite shore. Charon stands at the
bow, expertly guiding the boat with the pole. He turns it
towards the opening of the path, and lands the boat on the
shore with relative ease despite the speed of the river. It
rests on the bank with a sandy crunch, and Percy and Roger
immediately hop out.
ROGER
Thank you!
CHARON
Farewell.
He pushes the boat off shore and back out on the river. It
rapidly carries him downstream, away from where they began.
ROGER
Where do you think he's going now?
PERCY
I have no idea. Let's get going,
this place gives me the creeps.
They continue up the path.
ROGER
Percy, look!
There is a wooden door in the stone wall, right where the
path ends.
PERCY
Ah ha! We've made it.
They hurry down the rest of the path and pull open the door.
INT. JOHN'S DINING HALL - NIGHT
John Barleycorn is seated at the head of a very long dining
table, where two candles burn brightly in their holders. A
large fire roars in the fireplace off to the side.
43.
On the mantle above, there is a large civil war saber mounted
in its scabbard. John sits stroking his beard, looking
relaxed. A door in the corner opens to reveal Mandrake, with
Will standing behind him.
MANDRAKE
Your guest of honor is here, sir.
JOHN
Ah, wonderful! Bring him in.
Mandrake enters the room with Will trailing behind. He looks
terrified, and his eyes dart nervously about the room. They
approach the table, and Mandrake motions for Will to take a
seat at the corner, next to John. He sits down obediently,
but hangs his head, not looking at anyone. Mandrake stands
off to the side at attention.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Well, how are you my boy? I must
apologize for your current
quarters, I didn't want you to run
away. But you wouldn't do that,
you're a good boy, aren't you?
Will looks up at him and nods his head.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Of course. I knew you were. We're
going to put you in a much more
comfortable room tonight. But I'm
being rude; do you know what my
name is?
Will shakes his head, no.
JOHN (CONT'D)
That's all right, I'll tell you. My
name is John Barleycorn, and this
whole place...belongs to me. The
fields, the trees, the sky.
Everything, really.
WILL
(confused)
You can't own the sky.
JOHN
Oh, but I can. I own it like you
own a small toy train, for example.
It's just another one of my
playthings. Incidentally, I also
own a real train, but it's still
just a toy.
44.
(MORE)
It could all be yours Will, that's
why I've brought you here, you see?
You'll live with me, and have a
brand new room, and you'll be able
to do anything you want.
WILL
I like it in my own room, with
Roger. I just want to go home.
JOHN
With Roger, did you say?
WILL
He's my brother, I know he's coming
to find me.
JOHN
Hm.. That very well may be. But
wouldn't you like it, Will, if
Roger could live here with you,
too? Then you'd never have to go
home.
WILL
No! I don't like it here.
JOHN
Come now, son, it's not all bad. I
think you'll come to love it, in
fact.
Will hangs his head again, defeated.
WILL
Why are you keeping me here?
JOHN
Keeping you? I wouldn't put it that
way but...it will take some
explaining.
John gets up from the table and heads to another door, behind
the head of the table.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Come here, I want to show you
something.
Will stands up and shuffles over to the door. John claps a
hand on his shoulder and they disappear into the room.
45.
JOHN (CONT'D)
INT. THE CHAMBER OF THE CRYSTAL BALL - NIGHT
Will and John are standing in a dimly lit chamber, in the
middle of which stands a large glowing orb. They move closer,
and see that milky clouds are swirling about in a frenzy,
emitting small white flashes of light. Will stares in
amazement.
WILL
What is that?
JOHN
It is what I use to see around this
place. I can't be everywhere at
once, you know. Look closer, tell
me what you see.
Will does as he is told, and the clouds appear to separate.
The plains come into view, and then the train itself,
rumbling along through the landscape. He looks closer. The
ball shows him a much more detailed view of the train, and
then even closer on the platform between two cars positioned
close to the front. Will can now make out his brother and
Percy, now sitting up and talking animatedly. He gasps.
WILL
Roger!
John quickly comes around to where Will is standing, and
looks closely.
JOHN
What, what is it? Do you see your
brother?
WILL
Yes! And he's talking to...a bird!
JOHN
(muttering)
Then it's just as I suspected.
They're going to Mother Florence's.
WILL
They're getting up! I think they're
going into that traincar.
JOHN
Yes, yes, of course, they have to.
You'll have to excuse me son, I
have to go attend to something.
46.
(MORE)
Wait right here, I won't be a
minute.
Will hardly even hears him. John leaves the room, while he
continues to stare at the crystal ball which only shows the
train rolling along the tracks. Roger and Percy have
disappeared into the second car, and Will waits for some sign
of them on the other side.
INT. A PRIVATE ROOM IN JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
John sits in a large, old-fashioned easy chair in a small,
private smoking room. A lamp stands by his side, and a pipe
and ashtray are on a small table below it. He is wearing a
pair of reading glasses, and writes quickly but carefully
with a fountain pen on a piece of parchment.
INSERT - THE NOTE, which reads:
"The boy and Percy are headed for
Mother Florence. They MUST NOT make
contact with her. Intercept the
travelers, or take care of Flo - I
leave it in your hands. It is
IMPERATIVE that you do not fail!"
John signs the letter with his first name, and carefully
rolls up the piece of parchment. He then ties it with a thin
piece of string, and places it on the table next to him. John
stands up from his chair, and walks out of frame towards the
camera. We hear the metallic sound of a cage being opened,
and a clamorous rustling of wings. John walks back to his
chair with a beautiful peregrine falcon perched on his arm.
This is John's beloved pet, XERXES. He takes the rolled up
note and ties it carefully to one of the falcon's legs.
JOHN
I need this delivered right away,
Xerxes, do you hear me?
Amazingly, the bird nods its head.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Good. You know who to bring it to.
John quickly walks outside through the screen door on his
porch, and with a wave of his arm Xerxes is launched into the
air, beating his wings and twisting off into the night sky.
After he has flown off, John turns to go back inside the
house.
47.
JOHN (CONT'D)
INT. THE CHAMBER OF THE CRYSTAL BALL - NIGHT
John enters the room to find Will still staring perplexedly
at the ball.
JOHN
I'm back, son. What do you see now?
WILL
I don't know, they went inside and
I haven't seen them since.
JOHN
Let me show you something else,
then.
John waves a hand over the ball, and clouds and lights swirl
about, obscuring the image of the train. After a moment the
ball clears, revealing a new image. It is a massive field of
wheat, with peasants dotted about, working hard under the
sun.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You see all those people?
WILL
Yes.
JOHN
At this very moment, those people
and hundreds more just like them,
are working for me.
WILL
What do you mean?
JOHN
These fields, this land...it's all
mine, Will. If those people out
there do a good job, I make sure
they get fed. But I can't do it by
myself.
WILL
Why not?
JOHN
I'm getting old, I can't keep track
of things like I used to. My
kingdom is rather large, you see.
48.
WILL
Oh..
JOHN
But once you get to know the place,
it doesn't feel so big. When you've
lived here as long as I have, it
can seem kind of small in a way. Do
you see what I mean?
WILL
Yeah, I guess so..
JOHN
It's getting late, I think it's
time I showed you to your new room.
Will yawns and rubs his eyes sleepily.
WILL
Okay.
They leave the chamber of the crystal ball, passing again
through the dining room, and John takes Will up a winding set
of stairs to the top of the building. He shows him into his
room, which is by no means extravagant, but certainly very
comfortable. In fact, it looks exactly the same as the room
that Roger awoke from in his dream.
JOHN
I trust you'll be comfortable in
here?
WILL
Yes...
JOHN
Good. Get some sleep, and I'll see
you in the morning. We have a big
day ahead of us.
Will walks over to his bed and starts taking off his shoes.
John closes the door and heads back downstairs.
EXT. THE TRAINCAR PLATFORM - DAY
Roger and Percy are sitting on the platform. The sun has
begun to set, and it casts long shadows on the prairie as the
train rolls along.
49.
ROGER
All right. So what do we have to do
next?
PERCY
What we have to do next, is go
through that door and speak to an
old acquaintance of mine. Please be
careful, all right? We're almost
there.
ROGER
I'll be careful, I promise.
They both get up, and move towards the door. Roger opens it,
and they step through. Like the ones before, it bangs shut
behind them, seemingly on its own.
EXT. A WIDE OPEN PLAIN - NIGHT
The two riders tear across the prairie at full gallop, their
horses panting with exertion. The plain rumbles beneath them
as their hooves beat the earth. Suddenly, from above, Xerxes
swoops down and glides between them, screeching loudly to
alert them of his presence. Luther turns back just in time,
and he sticks out his arm for the bird to land upon. It does,
and the two Rangers bring their horses to an abrupt halt.
LUTHER
What brings you here, friend?
MARTIN
Unwrap his leg.
Luther looks closer and sees that a note is indeed wrapped
around Xerxes' leg. He gently takes it off and unfurls it.
LUTHER
I can't read it, come here and give
me a light.
Martin guides his horse over and lights a match, by which
they are able to make out what John has written.
LUTHER (CONT'D)
(reading the note)
Trying to get to Mother
Florence's...must not make
contact...
They read a moment longer.
50.
MARTIN
Seems pretty straight-forward to
me.
Luther pockets the note and looks up at Martin.
LUTHER
Well, look, we know what John wants
done, he doesn't care how we do it.
I say we head straight for Flo's.
MARTIN
Fine by me.
They whip the horses into motion and gallop off on a slightly
altered course. Xerxes takes off back in the direction of
John's house.
INT. A DIMLY LIT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Percy and Roger stand in front of the door inside a large,
well-furnished living room. Bookshelves line the walls,
filled to the ceiling with volumes, and a large fire roars in
the fireplace. A ornately-carved rotating wooden armchair
stands in the middle of the room with its back to the
travelers. A puff of pipe smoke floats into the air, and the
chair swivels about to reveal a very old man, NICK. He is
extremely small and fragile looking, and the chair seems to
all but swallow him up whole. He wears bifocals and a
weathered tweed jacket, and he considers Roger and Percy
carefully while smoking a long-stemmed pipe.
PERCY
Hello, Nick.
NICK
Why, hello, Percy!
His voices wheezes with mustiness, and the weight of his
years seems to be present in each word.
NICK (CONT'D)
And what sort of guest did you
bring with you this evening?
PERCY
This is my friend, Roger. We're
both in a bit of a predicament you
see...it's a long story, I won't
bore you, but ah.. Well, we simply
must see the conductor...please?
51.
There is a note of desperation in Percy's voice.
NICK
Roger, come over here for a moment.
My eyes aren't so good, let me have
a look at you.
Roger does as he is asked, and Nick looks him over with
beady, staring eyes.
NICK (CONT'D)
Have you ever played checkers,
Roger?
ROGER
Sure, all the time. My brother and
I play..used to play all the time.
NICK
Good, that's good. If there is one
thing I love, it's a good game of
checkers against a worthy opponent.
Would you like to play a game?
Roger looks over at Percy, unsure.
ROGER
I guess so...but Percy isn't lying,
we really need to see the
conductor.
Nick laughs, but it ends in sharp coughing.
NICK
You're a well-spoken boy, Roger. I
know he isn't lying. I tell you
what...
Nick reaches down beside his chair and pulls out a
checkerboard, along with a small bag of checkers. He places
them on an end table, and motions for Roger to sit on the
divan that is nearby. Roger moves it over next to the table
and takes a seat, still looking very apprehensive.
NICK (CONT'D)
You and I will play a game. Just
one game. If you win, I'll let you
and Percy go through, but if you
lose, it's back the way you came.
Roger gulps and looks at Percy again. Percy shrugs his
shoulders, adding a look that says 'we have no choice.'
52.
ROGER
Okay. I'll play. But you have to
promise to let us through if I win.
NICK
I promise. But there's a catch. For
every piece you jump, I will ask
you something. A riddle. Answer it
incorrectly, and you lose your
piece instead. But get it right,
and you take an extra one of mine.
ROGER
(indignant)
What about when you jump one of my
pieces?
Nick laughs.
NICK
Well, then, you've just lost a
piece!
PERCY
If I may interject, Nick, that
hardly seems fair!
Nick answers coolly, but his tone rises slightly in anger.
NICK
Now, Percy, it hardly seems
appropriate for you to dictate the
rules of MY favorite game, to ME,
in MY living room. Does it?
PERCY
No..
NICK
I'm glad we agree. Then let us play
on, my boy. Unless of course, you'd
rather go back...
PERCY
No! Absolutely not. He'll play.
Right, Roger?
Roger nods, and dutifully turns towards the board, where Nick
is already setting up the pieces. They are beautiful: small
ornate discs carved by hand out of ivory and ebony. They snap
sharply against the wooden board as Nick expertly lays them
down.
53.
NICK
All right, Roger, you go first.
Roger makes his move, and Nick makes his almost immediately
after, without any hesitation at all. Roger considers the
board carefully, then slowly makes his second move. Nick
comes back with another instantaneous placement. Roger does
not seem intimidated. Percy does, however, and he paces about
the room nervously. Roger loses a couple of pieces, but then
he makes a clever double jump to threaten two of Nick's
checkers.
NICK (CONT'D)
Well, well, that's a good move!
Now, I believe that's two riddles I
owe you..
ROGER
Now hold on a minute! That's not
right. If I had jumped two pieces
on different turns, sure, you would
ask me two riddles. But I doublejumped. That means you ask me one,
and if I get it right, I've
captured two more.
Nick looks a little astonished at this display of boldness.
NICK
Ah..hm.. I like your tenacity,
Roger. You're my kind of player!
One question for four of my pieces
then, eh? Naturally I'll have to
think of something
rather...perplexing. Don't forget,
I'm asking you alone, Roger. No
help from your fine-feathered
friend over there.
Nick pauses and puffs his pipe, thinking carefully about
which riddle to select. After a moment, he looks up. He's got
it.
NICK (CONT'D)
The life I lead is all too short;
and all the while I am consumed.
I'm fast when thin, and slow when
fat, and my only enemy is the wind.
What am I?
Roger's face goes blank.
54.
ROGER
I...I don't know.
Percy looks terrified.
PERCY
Come on, Roger, think!
NICK
Quiet, Percy.
Roger gets over his initial befuddlement and frowns, thinking
hard.
ROGER
(to himself)
Consumed all my life...only enemy
is the wind. Something that burns!
So...fast when thin, slow when
fat...a life all too short...
He looks up at Nick and smiles.
ROGER (CONT'D)
I've got it! You're a candle.
NICK
(taken aback)
Ah..Well done my boy! But of course
that was an exceedingly easy one.
Next time it won't be so...selfexplanatory.
Roger looks back at Percy with a smile. He collects his two
jumped pieces, and then moves to select two more from Nick's
side.
NICK (CONT'D)
Now, now, just a moment. I think
I'll pick those extra two.
He strategically takes two of his pieces, which create
perfect open lanes to capture Roger's men.
NICK (CONT'D)
There you go!
He hands the pieces to Roger, who accepts them with a
grimace.
PERCY
Well that's helpful.
55.
ROGER
Don't worry, Percy, I'm really good
at this game. You'll see.
NICK
(mockingly)
Yes, you'll see. My turn, I
believe?
Nick quickly makes a double jump on Roger, on two pieces that
were poised to attack him. Roger groans.
NICK (CONT'D)
(smugly)
Your move.
Roger carefully considers the board. He sees his move, and
jumps one of Nick's pieces.
NICK (CONT'D)
Well, another good move, my young
friend. But you know the rules. Now
let's see...
Roger looks back at Percy, unsure that he will be able to
solve the next riddle.
NICK (CONT'D)
Mhmm, mhmm. Okay, I've got it. This
one should stump you.
He pauses for a moment, remembering how it goes.
NICK (CONT'D)
The poor have me; the rich need me.
I am greater than John Barleycorn,
and more evil than the Famine. If
you eat me, you will die. What am
I?
ROGER
More evil than the Famine?
NICK
Of course, the Famine. She's the
most evil force ever to appear in
this land.
ROGER
You must be...nothing.
Nick curses under his breath.
56.
NICK
I don't believe it. Confound it
all, that was my best riddle!
He picks up the captured checker and an extra one from the
other side. In his frustration, he does not realize that he
has exposed himself to the perfect triple jump. Roger's eyes
light up, but Nick does not notice.
NICK (CONT'D)
(crossly)
Well, never mind. It's my turn.
He makes a rather hasty move, only taking one of Roger's
pieces, but setting himself on the back row to be kinged.
NICK (CONT'D)
You know what to do, eh?
Roger nods and takes one of Nick's captured men and places it
on top.
NICK (CONT'D)
In trouble now, I think. Go ahead.
Roger picks up his piece and jumps three of Nick's remaining
six pieces, slowly and deliberately. Nick gasps.
NICK (CONT'D)
What?! Oh no...
PERCY
Ha! I suggest you think of a good
one Nick. If he gets this one
right, you're finished!
Nick knits his brow, ignoring Percy.
NICK
(to himself)
Hm...must come up with a good one.
One he's sure not to know.
No...no...no...something different.
Yes! I've got it.
Nick looks up with a sinister grin.
NICK (CONT'D)
You'll never get this one. But
first...
He produces an ordinary-looking brass key, and lays it down
on the table next to the checkerboard.
57.
NICK (CONT'D)
You probably want to see what
you're playing for. This key will
take you through the door behind
me, and then you're home free.
Percy has hopped up onto the mantle of the fireplace, a few
feet above the players' heads. He looks down at their table,
eyeing the key eagerly. Nick notices the look.
NICK (CONT'D)
Don't get any of your clever ideas,
Percy! This key won't work unless I
tell it to. Now then, are you
ready, Roger?
He nods his head.
NICK (CONT'D)
Then here it is. I am large as a
mountain, but I look small as a
pea. I float on forever in a
waterless sea. What am I?
EXT. THE ROOF OF WILL AND ROGER'S TREEHOUSE - NIGHT -
FLASHBACK
Roger and Will lie on the roof of their treehouse, looking up
at the glittering sky above.
ROGER
Will, look, a shooting star!
He traces its path across the sky with one finger while Will
looks on in fascination.
WILL
Wow...that's amazing. How do stars
stay up in the sky, Roger?
ROGER
I don't know...I guess they just
float there.
WILL
(laughing)
Like beach balls in the ocean!
ROGER
Yeah, I guess so. But there isn't
any water in space, Will.
58.
WILL
Yeah, I know. How big do you think
they really are?
ROGER
How big do I think what really are?
WILL
The stars, Roger!
ROGER
Oh. Hm. Well, imagine somebody
reached down and ripped Mount
Katahdin off the face of Maine, and
tossed it into space.
WILL
It'd get burnt up in the
atmosphere.
ROGER
No, no, it just gets tossed into
space. Like a beach ball in the
ocean, right?
WILL
Yeah...
ROGER
That's how big stars are.
WILL
Wow! Really?
ROGER
Yep. They're big as mountains, they
just look tiny from here.
INT. NICK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY
Roger looks up with a triumphant smile on his face. Nick is
confused.
NICK
What, what is it? What am I?
ROGER
That's easy, you're a star.
NICK
What?! That's impossible! How did
you know?
59.
ROGER
I just remembered something that my
brother said once.
NICK
This is ridiculous. Forget it, you
cheated!
As the words leave his lips, Percy jumps down from his perch
and scoops the key up in his beak, right before Nick can grab
it.
NICK (CONT'D)
Hey, that's mine!
PERCY
You promised us we would get
through if he beat you. It was fair
and square!
NICK
I'll show you fair and square!
He makes a move to stand up, but he suddenly erupts into a
coughing fit, and immediately sits back down. After a moment,
he breathes easy again, though he seems greatly subdued.
NICK (CONT'D)
I'm...sorry. I shouldn't have
accused you of cheating. You're a
worthy opponent Roger, quite
cunning.
PERCY
Tell the key to work, Nick. Please.
NICK
'This key shall turn that lock'.
There, that's all it is. It will
work now. Go on, I must rest.
Roger takes the key from Percy, and the bolt turns smoothly
as he unlocks the door.
EXT. THE TRAINCAR PLATFORM - NIGHT
Percy and Roger emerge into the night air on the final
platform before the main car.
PERCY
Roger, that was amazing! How did
you solve those riddles?
60.
ROGER
I don't know, they just came to me.
PERCY
Well, you've saved our shot at
seeing the conductor yet again. I
thank you from the bottom of my
heart, Roger. You are a true
companion!
ROGER
Thanks, Percy. Don't mention it.
PERCY
All right, we're almost there. I
must tell you, it's very important
that we're polite to the conductor.
Otherwise, he might not help us. Do
you understand?
ROGER
Yes.
PERCY
Good. Then let's go.
They open the door and step inside.
INT. THE CONDUCTOR'S CAB
A dimly lit figure stands at the front of the train, his
hands on the controls and his eyes on the tracks ahead. It is
THE CONDUCTOR, and he wears a blue visored railway hat, along
with blue overalls. He does not appear to notice the entrance
of Roger and Percy. The pair walks closer.
CONDUCTOR
Hold it. Names.
They stop.
PERCY
(clearing his throat)
Ah, it's Percy, sir, and this is my
friend Roger.
CONDUCTOR
Roger, eh? You handled Nick pretty
well back there.
ROGER
Um.. Thank you. How did you know?
61.
CONDUCTOR
Oh, I know pretty much everything
that goes on this in this train.
Gotta keep an eye on things, you
know.
ROGER
Yes..of course.
CONDUCTOR
Naturally, I know where you fellas
want to go. I can drop you off at
the next station, and it's maybe a
half hour walk from there. We
should we arriving shortly.
Percy and Roger exchange looks of relief.
EXT. THE TRAIN
The black cab of the locomotive lumbers along into the night.
EXT. THE TRAIN STATION - LATER
Rolling gently along, the train arrives at the station and
makes a full stop alongside a platform. Roger and Percy
emerge from the door in the cab, looking around. The building
attached to the platform is quite decrepit and seems to be
abandoned, and lights from the train cause eerie shadows to
leap around the broken shards of windowpane. They look back
at the conductor still in the cab, and he waves goodbye to
them. The train begins to start up, and soon rolls away from
the station.
The travelers depart from the platform and begin their
journey, headed away from the train.
PERCY
Come on, I know the way. It's not
far from here.
They hike along into the distance, with wind blowing clouds
of dust across the sweeping plain.
EXT. THE OPEN PLAINS - NIGHT
Martin and Luther trot along on their steeds, approaching
what appears to be a campfire a little ways in the distance.
62.
MARTIN
All right. So are we clear on the
plan?
LUTHER
Absolutely.
EXT. A SMALL CAMPSITE - NIGHT
A campfire roars in the center of three tents, pitched around
in a circle, their entrances facing in. Seated on a small
wooden chair is MOTHER FLORENCE, a middle-aged, dark skinned
woman wearing a handkerchief on her head and a dusty cotton
dress. She looks pensively at the fire. A small boy emerges
from the tent by her side. It is her son CALVIN, 6 years old.
CALVIN
Mama, why are you still awake?
MOTHER FLORENCE
Oh, I can't sleep, honey, that's
all.
CALVIN
Why not? What's wrong?
MOTHER FLORENCE
I just have a bad feeling.
Something isn't right.
CALVIN
I don't know, mama, everything
seems all right.
She smiles and strokes his hair affectionately.
MOTHER FLORENCE
You're probably right child.
Nothing to worry about.
CALVIN
I'm gonna go back to sleep, I'm
tired again.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Okay. Sweet dreams, dear.
CALVIN
Good night, mama.
He retreats back into his tent, laying down on a soft spread
of furs.
63.
He rests his head on the pillow and quickly falls asleep
again. Mother Florence does not bother sleeping, despite her
son's attempt to soothe her. She stares at the fire a moment
longer.
Suddenly, she pricks up her ears. Faintly, in the distance,
she can hear the sound of hoof beats. The riders are
galloping full-tilt towards Mother Florence's campsite.
CUT TO:
EXT. MOTHER FLORENCE'S CAMPSITE
She stands up in terror, and looks out into the night trying
to make out the horses.
CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAMPSITE
Martin and Luther close in, firing their guns in the air as
they bear down on the tents.
CUT TO:
EXT. CAMPSITE
Mother Florence now sees the white horses and their riders
emerge out of the darkness. She screams in terror, and
hurries to wake her children up. Calvin and his little sister
MAISY are clearly distressed at having been disturbed from
their slumber.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Wake up, wake up, wake up! We have
to go, now!!
The children drowsily raise themselves out of bed, but
suddenly gunshots go off extremely close to their tents. Fear
shakes them fully awake, and they immediately begin to cry,
reaching out for their mother. They leave the tent to hear
the thunderous sound of hooves bearing down on them, fast.
Mother Florence turns to run away from the campsite with her
children, but from out of the darkness come the two Rangers,
like white angels of death. The massive horses easily trample
the tents and campfire, flaring their nostrils with
exhilaration. Martin and Luther look about, and easily spot
Mother Florence and the children trying to escape into the
night.
64.
LUTHER
There!
They rally the horses and gallop towards the trio. Each
ranger reaches out with brawny arms, and plucks up a member
of the group, right off the ground. Martin snatches Calvin,
and Luther picks up Mother Florence herself. Maisy stands
alone on the prairie, crying hysterically.
MAISY
Mama, come back, come back!
Instead of her Mother, however, it is Martin coming back. He
has Calvin gripped under one arm, kicking and struggling, and
while still controlling the horse and the boy he manages to
scoop up Maisy as well. He spins his horse back around and
rides off into the darkness to follow Luther back to John's.
INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
John leaves Will's room, shutting the door gently behind him.
He walks down the long hallway, down the stairs, and enters
the dining hall.
INT. THE DINING HALL
Mandrake stands at attention by the far wall. He stares at
the fire, still roaring by the table. John takes a seat at
the table.
JOHN
He's asleep. Shouldn't be too long
now.
MANDRAKE
Yes sir. One hour left until
midnight.
JOHN
He'll learn to like it here,
Mandrake.
MANDRAKE
After the portal closes forever,
he'll have to, sir.
JOHN
Right as usual. Only, his brother
and Percy are still out there,
wandering around.
65.
MANDRAKE
With Mother Florence in our care,
sir, they may very well end up lost
on the plains forever.
JOHN
You're right again, Mandrake. Well,
let them wander. I already have one
boy who can be a good son. If Percy
and Roger are lost forever, it's of
no particular concern to me. Kill
two birds with one stone, I say.
MANDRAKE
I believe you mean one bird and one
boy, sir.
They share an evil laugh.
INT. THE DOOR TO THE DINING HALL
Will stands in the hallway with his ear pressed to the door.
Understandably, he was having some trouble getting to sleep.
Realizing that their conversation is about him, he turns to
run down the hallway. His eyes dart about like a frightened
animal, and he runs for the door at the other end of the
hall. He finds himself in the kitchen. He sees the exit at
the other end of the hall and sprints for it, then opens the
screen door and dashes down the porch steps. His flight is
brought to an abrupt halt, however, as he runs straight into
the outstretched arms of Luther, who is standing guard with
Martin. Will screams in terror and struggles to get free, but
Luther handles him easily.
LUTHER
Whoa! Where do you think you're
goin', cowboy?
WILL
Put me down!!
MARTIN
These kids...why you think they're
always tryin' to run away, Luther?
LUTHER
I don't know, but I can make damn
sure it doesn't happen again.
66.
They walk inside the house, striding purposefully towards the
dining room with Will still kicking and struggling under
Luther's arm. They burst the door open and walk in to very
surprised looks from John and Mandrake.
JOHN
What...what's going on?
LUTHER
Your boy, boss, he was tryin' to
get away.
JOHN
Is that so?
MARTIN
Yes sir, Luther nabbed him just as
he was jumping off your porch.
Looked like he was runnin' from the
Devil himself.
WILL
Put me down, NOW!
JOHN
Oh you'll be put down, my young
friend, in your original quarters.
I thought you were a good boy,
Will, I guess I was wrong. Luther?
Take him down to the cells, please.
LUTHER
You got it, boss.
The Rangers turn to go, taking Will with them.
MANDRAKE
He'll get used to it, sir.
JOHN
Oh I know, it takes time just like
anything else. I have very high
hopes for this one.
INT. THE DUNGEON - NIGHT
The Rangers emerge from the heavy metal door to the dungeon
and walk down the few steps to the main row of cells. Luther
still carries Will, but he has stopped struggling and merely
weeps quietly. Martin takes a ring of keys from a hook on the
wall, and opens the cell down the hall on the left.
67.
Luther sets him down inside the cell on his cot. Will
immediately turns over on his side, and stares at the wall.
Martin and Luther exit, and Martin locks the door shut, then
returns the ring of keys to its hook. They leave, clanging
the hall door behind them.
MOTHER FLORENCE (O.S.)
Hey! Hey over there!
Will gets up and looks across to the opposite cell. Inside
are Mother Florence and her children, who lie sleeping on
their cots.
WILL
Who are you?
MOTHER FLORENCE
My name is Mother Florence, child,
what's your name?
WILL
I'm Will.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Are you the little boy that was
coming to see me, with Percy?
WILL
Huh? No. Who's Percy?
MOTHER FLORENCE
Oh you know, Percy, the talking
crow, he was coming with you!
WILL
No, I never met any talking crows.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Hmm..Wait a minute, it was your
brother! You've got a brother,
haven't you, Will?
WILL
Yeah! My older brother, Roger. He's
coming to get us, I saw him!
MOTHER FLORENCE
Of course, of course, it all makes
sense now. Except, how did you see
him?
68.
WILL
John Barleycorn showed me, with his
crystal ball. They were on the
train and I saw them go inside one
of the cars.
MOTHER FLORENCE
That's right, they're on the train.
They were coming to see me, for
help in getting you back, child.
WILL
I knew it! But, how do you know
about them?
MOTHER FLORENCE
Oh, the conductor told me a couple
days ago, said he's expecting to
drop off some passengers by my
station and to keep my eyes out.
WILL
Oh..
MOTHER FLORENCE
Well, it's all right, I'm sure
you're brother is on his way right
now. Don't worry a bit.
WILL
Yeah, I think you're right. I hope
he gets here soon!
INT. THE DINING HALL
John sits at the head of the table, with Mandrake, Martin,
and Luther seated around him.
JOHN
Now look, gentlemen, we all know
the portal closes for good at
midnight. We've lost one boy on the
plains, and the other one almost
got away once tonight. I do not
want it to happen again. There has
been too much laziness, and
stupidity, and inactivity around
here lately, and frankly, I'm
getting very tired of it.
The three men exchange looks of confusion.
69.
MARTIN
Boss...we haven't done anything
wrong.
JOHN
I don't care! The boy must not
escape. Do you think you can handle
that?
MARTIN
Yes, boss.
LUTHER
Yes, boss.
MANDRAKE
Yes, sir.
JOHN
Just make sure things go smoothly,
for once.
MARTIN
The boy is locked up tight, along
with Mother Florence and her kids.
They're not going anywhere, boss.
JOHN
Good. Well, all that's left to do
is wait.
MANDRAKE
Half an hour until midnight, sir.
EXT. MOTHER FLORENCE'S CAMPSITE - NIGHT
Roger and Percy arrive at the campsite to find it completely
ransacked. The tents have been crushed, and the campfire is a
smoldering mess. Broken tent poles stick out of the ground
like broken bones. A lonely trail of smoke curls through the
air.
ROGER
(shocked)
What happened?
PERCY
Oh no, no, no, this is terrible!
How can this be?
They quickly look through the wreckage of the campsite, and
determine that no one is there.
70.
ROGER
They're gone, Percy. Somebody took
them.
PERCY
I know who.
ROGER
You do?
PERCY
Who else could have done this? It
has to be the work of those two
ogres, Martin and Luther.
ROGER
Who are they?
PERCY
Men who work for John Barleycorn.
He likes to call them his Rangers.
ROGER
Oh..what do we do?
PERCY
We have to go there. To John's.
ROGER
But how? Do you know the way?
PERCY
No, but I know how to get there.
Percy makes a wide gesture at the ground. Roger looks down
and sees a flurry of hoof prints in the dust, which make a
few loops and then form two sets running off into the
darkness. Roger looks up at Percy in understanding.
ROGER
Let's go!
PERCY
Lead the way, my friend.
The duo runs off to follow the hoof prints.
EXT. JOHN'S FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
Roger and Percy pull up in front of the house, gasping for
breath. They look up at the house, which looms ominously
before them, shrouded in shadows.
71.
Beyond the house, a gloomy-looking forest rises up into the
sky like black, skeletal fingers.
PERCY
This is it. From here on, things
could get dangerous. We must be
extremely careful.
The house appears dark and silent. No activity is detectable
from outside.
ROGER
Once we get inside, let's split up
to find Will.
PERCY
How will you get around?
ROGER
Something tells me I've been here
before. I'll be all right.
PERCY
Okay. Let's go.
They proceed into the house.
INT. JOHN'S HOUSE
Percy and Roger cautiously open the screen door and step
inside. They listen carefully, but hear nothing. Candles
flicker in holders on the wall, dimly lighting the interior.
PERCY
(whispering)
I'll go this way. You check in the
basement.
Roger gives him the thumbs up. Percy proceeds down the
hallway, treading ever so softly. Roger heads for the door to
the basement, and begins his descent down the steps.
INT. THE DUNGEON
Will and Mother Florence sit in their separate cells. Maisy
and Calvin have woken up, and they sit on the floor passing a
ball back and forth. They look over and see Will, alone,
hanging his head.
CALVIN
Hey, you want to play?
72.
Will looks up eagerly.
WILL
Yeah!
CALVIN
Okay. I'll pass you the ball, and
you have to bounce it back through
the bars. Think you can do it?
WILL
Yes, I think so.
CALVIN
Good! Every time you get it back
through, it's ten points.
Will gets up and stands ready by the bars. Calvin bounces it
across, straight into Will's outstretched hands. Aiming
carefully, he sends it back across the corridor, through the
bars to Calvin.
CALVIN (CONT'D)
Good one! Now it's my turn.
Will steps back, and Calvin lobs the ball to him.
WILL
Ten points!
MAISY
I want to try!
CALVIN
All right, catch this one and then
throw it back.
MAISY
Okay.
Will tosses the ball, and Maisy catches it.
MAISY (CONT'D)
I did it!
CALVIN
Good going, Maisy. Now toss it
back!
She lines the ball up with the bars on Will's cell, preparing
to throw.
73.
MOTHER FLORENCE
I don't know about this game,
children, you're going to lose that
ball. Then what will you play with?
CALVIN
We won't lose it, mama.
Maisy chucks the ball, but it bounces off one of the bars and
rolls down the hallway. It stops against the steps at the end
of the hall.
MAISY
Oh no...
CALVIN
Maisy! Why did you do that?!
MAISY
I'm sorry, Calvin, I missed!
MOTHER FLORENCE
Children, don't fight!
Suddenly the metal door above the steps begin to creak open.
CALVIN
Now look what you've done! We've
had it, Maisy.
She starts to cry. The door opens all the way to reveal a
triumphant Roger.
WILL
Roger!!
He dashes down the corridor to Will, who is overjoyed to see
him. They embrace through the bars.
ROGER
Will! How did you get here?
WILL
That man upstairs, John Barleycorn,
he put me here. I think he wants us
to stay here forever. This poor
lady told me John wrecked her home,
too.
Roger turns around to see Mother Florence and the children in
their cell.
74.
ROGER
Are you...Mother Florence?
MOTHER FLORENCE
Yes I am. You must be Roger. It's a
pleasure to finally meet you.
ROGER
Percy and I...we saw your camp. I'm
so sorry.
Mother Florence waves her hand dismissively.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Oh, that. What's important is that
we're all safe and sound, for now.
I think we really should get going,
though.
ROGER
All right, I'm getting you all out
of here.
WILL
Quick, the keys are on that hook
over there!
Roger dashes over and grabs the keys. He quickly finds the
one for Will's cell, and lets his brother out first. Then he
opens the door for Mother Florence, and they all move down
the hallway and out the door.
WILL (CONT'D)
Roger, who's Percy?
ROGER
Huh?
WILL
You said, 'Percy and I saw your
camp' when you were talking to
Mother Florence. Who is he?
ROGER
Oh...he's a talking crow I met on
the train.
WILL
A talking crow?! What...well, where
is he now?
75.
ROGER
We split up to look for you. He
should be upstairs, we'll find him
and then get out of here.
They open the door at the top of the stairs and emerge into
the entrance hall of the house.
ROGER (CONT'D)
He should be around here
somewhere...
PERCY (O.C.)
Help! Somebody help me!
They suddenly hear Percy's distress call, coming from
somewhere inside the house. Roger's face turns white.
ROGER
That's him! I have to go save him.
WILL
I'm not leaving you again, Roger.
Roger appears conflicted, but puts his hand on Will's
shoulder to acknowledge the gesture of loyalty.
ROGER
Okay.. Mother Florence, you should
take your children and get out of
here. This might be dangerous.
MOTHER FLORENCE
All right, child. We'll try to find
some way to help. Good luck to you
both!
CALVIN
Bye, Will!
WILL
Bye!
Mother Florence, Maisy, and Calvin all silently leave through
the screen door. She hurries them along once they get
outside. Roger and Will bravely continue on towards the sound
of Percy's cries for help. They turn the corner to go down
another hallway, and find a door that seems to be very close
to the sounds of distress.
76.
WILL (CONT'D)
This is the dining room. I don't
think we should go in there, Roger,
we can just leave right now.
ROGER
We can't just leave, Will, Percy's
in there! I would never have gotten
this far if it weren't for him, we
have to try and save him.
WILL
But Roger, I'm really scared! I
think he wants us to stay here
forever, I don't want that, I want
to play in our treehouse, I want to
see dad again!
Will begins to cry, and he sits down against the wall in
defeat. Roger sits down next to him and puts an arm around
his shoulder.
ROGER
Come on Will, don't worry, we're
going to be fine! Here, I've got
something for you.
Roger takes the Barlow knife out of his pocket and puts it in
Will's hand.
ROGER (CONT'D)
Here. Dad gave me this. It'll help
you be brave.
Will picks his head up. He opens the knife and looks at it in
the dim candlelight of the hallway.
ROGER (CONT'D)
Now, are you ready?
Will stands up.
WILL
Yes!
ROGER
All right. Now, on the count of
three. One..two..three!
They throw the door open and step into the main dining hall,
to see Mandrake, Luther, Martin, and John, all standing
around the fire place. They turn around, and the boys see
that Percy is being held tightly in John's hands.
77.
JOHN
Well! If it isn't our favorite
little Houdini impersonators!
Somehow I am not surprised.
ROGER
You! I dreamed about you.
JOHN
That's right, Roger. And now you're
here. I couldn't be more pleased.
ROGER
Put down my friend.
JOHN
Oh, I don't think so. Xerxes heard
him going upstairs and let me know
there was an intruder. And that's
just what you are, Percy. An
intruder.
PERCY
Put me down, John!
JOHN
I keep hearing that today.. Well,
as you wish.
John begins to lower Percy towards the roaring fire. He
struggles valiantly, but to no avail. John holds him firmly
and moves him closer to the blaze.
ROGER
No!!
Roger charges at John, but is intercepted by Luther, who
picks him up with one hand and pins him to the wall.
LUTHER
I am sick of you little kids
runnin' around all over the place!
Will bravely runs over and starts pounding on Luther's treetrunk sized leg. Luther gives him a swift kick, and Will
falls down in a daze against one of the benches at the table.
Percy appears to be done for. Suddenly, the doors burst open.
In walk Daniel, Nathan, and Isaac. They are wielding very
large scythes.
NATHAN
Hello, John.
78.
JOHN
Nathan! What a pleasant surprise.
He stops himself from moving Percy any closer to the fire.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Isaac, Daniel, nice to see you too.
Now, what can I do for you
gentlemen at this hour?
NATHAN
We're getting these boys out of
here. They need to go home, John.
JOHN
Why, here is home now, don't you
see?
He gestures towards Roger and Will.
JOHN (CONT'D)
These boys...they're going to love
living here.
NATHAN
I don't think so John. Now put down
the bird, he's coming with us too.
JOHN
Now, Nathan, don't make me laugh!
NATHAN
I'll ask you one last time. Put the
bird down, John.
JOHN
Enough of this ridiculous chitchat. Martin, Luther, please take
care of these guests. I think
they've worn out their welcome.
Luther lowers Roger to the ground, and the Rangers advance
menacingly upon the three men. Martin and Luther have a
distinct size advantage, and even though the men are armed
with scythes it seems like an unfair match.
NATHAN
Whoa, now hold on a minute! Those
wouldn't be your horses out there
right now, would they?
79.
Martin and Luther look out the window, just in time to see
their white horses riding helter skelter out into the
darkness, away from the house.
MARTIN
What the...
LUTHER
Perseus!
MARTIN
We gotta go, boss, I'm real sorry.
They dash out of the dining room and outside, chasing their
horses off into the night, running as fast as they can.
LUTHER
(fading away)
Perseus, baby, wait!
John looks at Mandrake expectantly.
JOHN
Well? Take care of them, Mandrake!
MANDRAKE
Ah, sir, I don't think I can do
that.
JOHN
What do you mean? Throw them out!!
MANDRAKE
I...I'm sorry.
Without another word, Mandrake turns his back and walks out
of the room. John turns back to Nathan with a look of fury.
JOHN
Well, this is just perfect.
He violently hurls Percy against the opposite wall, and he
crumples to the floor in a shower of feathers.
ROGER
Percy!
He runs over to help him. The three men advance on John.
JOHN
So it has come to this. Well, then,
on with it!
80.
In a flash, John reaches for the saber that is mounted on the
mantle. He whips it out of the scabbard and stands to
confront Nathan, Isaac, and Daniel. The three men charge.
John's saber clashes against scythe, and a tremendous battle
ensues. John skillfully parries away each blow from the three
men, and despite being heavily outnumbered, John seems to be
gaining the upper hand. He lashes out at Isaac, and manages
to clip his arm, drawing blood. Shouting in pain, he drops
his scythe with a loud clatter and staggers back. Daniel and
Nathan are left to fight John. He forces them back, and
Nathan and Daniel are rapidly running out of space. They
trade blows back and forth with John, who is standing under a
very large, very heavy-looking wooden chandelier covered in
candles.
NATHAN
Will, do something!
JOHN
Give it up, Nathan, this doesn't
concern you!
NATHAN
You're wrong John, these boys don't
belong here. They must be sent back
through the portal!
JOHN
It's almost midnight. Soon the
portal will close forever, and
William shall be my heir.
NATHAN
Heir? I think you mean slave. I
can't allow that, John, you have no
right! Just like you had no right
to keep me and my brothers here,
all those years ago.
JOHN
I'm sorry Nathan, it's far too late
for you to change anything.
Will sees that the chandelier is connected to a thin rope on
the far wall, and he dashes over to where it is tied off. He
struggles for a moment with the knot, then remembers the
knife in his pocket. He brings it out and begins to saw
through the rope. Nathan charges.
JOHN (CONT'D)
The boy...stays!!
81.
John locks his saber with Nathan's scythe, and with a
monumental amount of strength he hurls him back against the
wall. Daniel stands back, alone, unsure what to do. John
stands, breathing hard, preparing himself for the last
attack. Suddenly, however, Will cuts through the rope, and
the chandelier comes plummeting down. John looks up, but too
late - the heavy wood crashes down on him, pinning him to the
floor. Daniel lowers his scythe, relieved. Nathan recovers
himself and gets up.
NATHAN
Thank you.
John struggles under the crushing weight of the chandelier.
JOHN
(gasping)
Help me...get this off me, please!
NATHAN
I don't think so, John. Not yet.
Isaac, Daniel, you stay here and
watch him. Boys, come with me, we
have no time to lose!
The grandfather clock ticks steadily along, showing five
minutes to midnight. Roger gathers Percy up, and he and Will
leave the house with Nathan in the lead.
EXT. JOHN'S FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
The three figures emerge out of the house, and are greeted by
Mother Florence and her children. Calvin and Maisy cling to
her dress.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Oh thank goodness! I heard such
noise in there, I was sure
something terrible had happened.
NATHAN
Everything's all right now, ma'am,
I just need to get these two home
right away.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Yes, of course.
WILL
We'll be okay, Mother Florence!
82.
MOTHER FLORENCE
I know you will, child. Have a safe
trip, now.
ROGER
But where will you stay?
MOTHER FLORENCE
Oh, we'll put things back together
in the morning. No shame in
sleeping out in the open air for a
night.
NATHAN
Nonsense! There's a spare room in
our farmhouse, you can stay with
us.
MOTHER FLORENCE
Oh! Why, that's very kind of you.
Thank you.
NATHAN
Inside, talk to my brothers, Daniel
and Isaac. They will help you. Ah,
but we really must be going.
Farewell!
MOTHER FLORENCE
Goodbye!
She hurries inside with the children, and Nathan leads Roger
and Will around to the back of the house. The forest looms
eerily just beyond.
NATHAN
Come on! We have to run.
They take off across the small clearing behind the house, and
enter the forest. Nathan leads them to a very familiarlooking oak tree standing proudly in a clearing, away from
the other trees. The hole in the trunk shimmers with blue
light. They approach the tree.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Here, just like the first time.
You'll be home again soon. Are you
ready?
ROGER
Yes...but why did you decide to
help us?
83.
NATHAN
Well...it's a long story, but I
didn't always live in this place.
John brought me and my brothers
here too, like you boys. But it was
through a different portal, and
that was a long time ago. We never
got a chance to go home. I couldn't
let it happen to you too, it just
wasn't right. I'm sorry I let it
get this far, it was my fault..
ROGER
It's all right. Thank you.
NATHAN
Ah..you're welcome. But enough! You
have to go through now!
WILL
Goodbye!
NATHAN
Goodbye, children.
Will climbs up through the portal first, and drops through to
the brilliant blue depths below. Roger goes right behind him
with Percy cradled in his arms, and they disappear from the
land of John Barleycorn forever. Nathan watches a moment
longer, and the pool begins to waver and fade. Then, it
crackles out entirely. Nathan is left staring into the black
depths of an ordinary tree. He sighs and turns to go back to
the house.
INT. JOHN'S DINING HALL - NIGHT
Nathan enters the room to find his brothers sitting on a
bench by the table, looking utterly exhausted. John is still
lying on the floor underneath the chandelier, unmoving. They
look up as Nathan enters.
ISAAC
Nathan, right after you left...
NATHAN
What, what happened?
DANIEL
John Barleycorn is dead.
84.
EXT. THE BOYS' GARDEN - DAY
The boys land on the ground at the edge of the garden, and
they look around, seeing the house and everything else
exactly as they left it. The dew is still wet on the grass,
and it appears to be early morning. The sun rises to the
east, and they see their house up the hill past the garden,
just as it always was.
ROGER
We did it, Will! We did it.
The boys joyfully embrace, and Roger momentarily forgets all
about Percy, bumping him roughly.
PERCY
Hey! Be careful!
ROGER
Percy, you're awake! Are you all
right?
PERCY
Yes, just a little banged up. No
worse for the wear, though.
ROGER
Let's go inside, we'll get you
fixed up.
The boys hurry across the garden and up the hill to the house
in the early morning sunshine.
INT. THE HOUSE - DAY
Will sits with Percy at the dining room counter, while Roger
bustles about trying to find things that will help Percy. He
finds tape, popsicle sticks, and rubber bands, placing them
on the counter next to the injured bird. Percy, however, is
able to stand up and move around on his own, surprisingly.
ROGER
Wait, don't get up yet! You'll hurt
yourself.
PERCY
No, I don't think I will, I feel
amazing!
ROGER
Wait...really?
85.
PERCY
Yes, I don't feel hurt at all. In
fact...I feel something more than
that, too.
Percy looks at Roger with a gleam in his eye.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Roger, let's go outside, quickly!
ROGER
Okay, if you say so.
Roger abandons his search for first aid, and all three
characters rush outside with Percy in the lead.
EXT. THE GARDEN EDGE - DAY
The sun is now up, and the boys stand by the side of the
garden, looking at Percy quizzically.
ROGER
Well, what's the big fuss?
PERCY
My wings...they feel light again.
ROGER
Wait, are you saying...?
Not hesitating another moment, Percy leaps into the air and
beats his wings rapidly. Amazingly, he catches an updraft and
majestically soars upwards through the crisp morning air.
Roger and Will cheer excitedly and race along past the garden
as Percy swoops and dives, laughing with joy. He gets lower,
so they are within conversational range.
ROGER (CONT'D)
What happened? How can this be??
PERCY
I don't know, there is only one way
for this to happen and I can't
imagine...
ROGER
What, what's the only way for it to
happen?
Percy swoops low and lands at their feet.
86.
PERCY
Well, if he won't voluntarily give
me my wings back...John Barleycorn
must die for it to happen. Then all
the spells he ever put on the
innocent people and creatures will
vanish. But John Barleycorn can't
be dead, this doesn't make sense...
ROGER
But don't you remember? Will sent
that wooden thing crashing down on
his head. He must have died.
WILL
It looked awful heavy...I don't
think he survived.
PERCY
Tragic, I suppose. But you know he
wanted to keep you boys there
forever, right?
WILL
Yes..
PERCY
I was unconscious that whole time.
John really knocked me out by
throwing me against that wall.
That's the last thing I remember -
then I came to when your hugging
bent my leg backwards!
ROGER
Oh yeah...sorry about that.
PERCY
Well thank goodness you made it
back through. How did you know the
portal was behind John's house?
WILL
We didn't...Nathan, the man with
the scythe..
ROGER
He showed us how to get home.
PERCY
Ah yes, I do seem to remember them
showing up as our unlikely
rescuers.
87.
WILL
But Percy, now the portal's gone
forever, how will you ever get
home?
PERCY
(laughing)
Oh don't worry, my only home was on
that train, and I think I was
getting pretty tired of it, anyway.
I could get used to it here. It's
quite a bit greener, isn't it?
WILL
Yeah.
PERCY
Well boys, it's been a magnificent
adventure. I have some flying to do
though, it's been a long time.
ROGER
Come back and visit us! We'll meet
in the treehouse, just over there.
PERCY
By all means, my young friend.
Until then - farewell!
Turning around, the crow flaps his wings and takes off into
the air, sailing on a perfect gust of wind. He cruises higher
and higher, gaining altitude until the boys can just barely
see him. They turn to head back inside.
WILL
Roger, won't dad be upset that we
were gone for so long?
ROGER
I don't know. Maybe...
INT. THE KITCHEN
The boys go inside, and Roger busies himself with putting
away the things he had taken out for Percy. Will goes over to
look at the tear-away calendar sitting on the counter. It
shows Sunday, June 15th - the same day they left.
WILL
Roger, look! The calendar is the
same.
88.
ROGER
How can that be?
WILL
I'm not sure.
ROGER
Come on, let's go check on dad.
They dash upstairs, and peek their heads into dad's bedroom.
He is just getting up, rising sleepily from the covers.
DAD
Boys! Hi. You're up kind of early,
aren't you?
ROGER
Um..yeah! We wanted to see if you
would make us breakfast.
DAD
Sure, sure. Just give me a minute.
The boys go back downstairs.
WILL
He didn't know we were missing at
all, Roger.
ROGER
I know...it's strange. I guess
somehow time stopped while we were
both on the other side.
WILL
Time...stopped?
Dad comes down into the kitchen, wearing his bathrobe.
DAD
All right, what are we making,
pancakes, waffles, eggs?
ROGER
Dad, what day is it?
DAD
What day is it? It's Monday morning
Roger, did you forget or something?
ROGER
No, just wanted to check.
89.
DAD
All right. Let's see, I feel like
waffles today.
The boys nod their heads in agreement. They go to sit down at
the counter.
ROGER
Sounds good, dad.
Dad bustles around the kitchen, getting out the waffle maker
and ingredients.
DAD
So, what are you guys planning for
today. More work on the treehouse?
They do not respond. He looks up from mixing the batter to
see that they have both fallen asleep at the counter, using
their arms as pillows.
DAD (CONT'D)
Hm. I guess you guys were up a
little too early, huh.
He comes over and picks up Will in one arm, who rests his
head comfortably against dad's shoulder. He nudges Roger
awake, who flutters his eyes sleepily.
DAD (CONT'D)
Come on, let's go back to bed, you
can sleep a little longer.
ROGER
(yawning)
Okay.
DAD
Why are you guys so exhausted,
anyway?
ROGER
Oh we just..stayed up
late...reading.
DAD
Huh.
Carrying Will and leading Roger by the hand, dad takes the
two boys back up to their bedroom. He tucks Will in while
Roger gets under his covers and snuggles up to the pillow.
90.
DAD (CONT'D)
All right, sleep as long as you
want, we'll make the waffles when
you get up.
ROGER
(already almost asleep)
Okay, dad. I missed you.
DAD
(confused)
Missed me? I was just in my room
the whole night.
ROGER
Yeah, I know.
Dad smiles and tousles Roger's hair.
DAD
All right, I'll see you when you
get up.
The boys are fast asleep. Dad draws the curtains and leaves
the room, shutting the door gently.
CUT TO:
EXT. ABOVE THE FOREST - DAY
Percy soars high above the trees, swooping this way and that
to catch the wind. He flies by the house, and then flaps hard
and goes sailing off in the distance to explore his new home.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
91.
